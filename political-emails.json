But in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby County decision, which gutted Section 5 of the VRA, a wave of discriminatory voting changes have been unleashed on communities of color, affecting millions of voters.In fact, this will be the first presidential election in more than half a century without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act in place.The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund LDF is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 501c3 organization that has been at the forefront of civil rights litigation and advocacy for over 75 years. LDF has aggressively challenged barriers to voting in court, but without the full protections of the VRA, discriminatory legislation will keep coming up.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte have the power to hold a hearing right now about restoring these protections.Help us send a strong message that we will not stand by as millions of voters are stripped of their democratic right to vote. Sign the petition now  .Onward,Sherrilyn A.

We're now in the final weeks leading up to Election Day -- this is the moment we've been preparing for.Voters are now deciding. For governor, they have a clear choice. They can vote for Jay and his optimistic, progressive vision for Washington -- or his opponent's dire and pessimistic outlook.But make no mistake -- along with the choice between Jay and his opponent, voters are making a big decision about the kind of state we want to live in: one based on progressive values or one that turns backward on our progress.That's why it's essential we work non-stop over the next couple weeks to re-elect Jay Inslee as governor, and make sure Democrats fill in their ballots and return them by Tuesday, November 8th. Right Now: We're looking for 14 supporters in your zip who can make a quick donation to support our grassroots efforts reaching voters over the next 18 days. Can you help?  This election is a choice between economic justice, sustainable growth, great schools, combatting climate change, and keeping Washington open for business -- or stepping back to Republican trickle down policies benefiting only a few. We cannot leave anything on the table. It must be a concerted push to get ballots completed and returned.

It's not the time to commit to a giant, long-term spending bill, but that's exactly what many lawmakers will try to do.Instead, lawmakers should focus on passing a clean spending bill that extends to early 2017, when we will have a Congress that is fully accountable and capable of fulfilling the will of the people.We need to  pressure our lawmakers  to not use this Lame Duck session as an opportunity for more overspending and corporate welfare giveaways at the expense of the taxpayer.

And he plans to reverse President Obama's executive action that provides relief for people like me who were brought to the U.S. as children.Trump also wants to expand the use of stop-and-frisk, a practice that is essentially an open invitation for police officers to racially profile people of color.We must do everything we can to protect communities that will be targeted by the racist and xenophobic Trump administration. That's why one of Our Revolution's top priorities in 2017 will be defending the rights of those who will be most vulnerable during Trump's presidency.Will you make a $3 contribution before tonight's end-of-year fundraising deadline to support Our Revolution's work protecting immigrants, Muslims, and anyone else who becomes a target under Trump? Revolution will be working at the state and local level to implement policies to keep immigrant families together, establish fair policing practices and allow all people to feel safe in their communities.When Trump tries to divide us and force millions of our sisters and brothers to live in fear, it will be up to us to stand up for and defend the rights of those who will be harmed by the policies of his administration.Sanctuary cities and states - places that protect undocumented immigrants from deportation - will be a central focus of our work. By working with grassroots organizations, we will ensure the existing protections granted by sanctuaries are kept in place while adopting those same protections in other cities and states across the country.Will you make a $3 contribution right now, ahead of tonight's end-of-year fundraising deadline, to help Our Revolution form the resistance movement against Trump? contribution we receive will send a powerful message that our movement is prepared to fight back against Trump's destructive plans for our country.Thank you for adding yours before tonight's midnight deadline.In solidarity,Erika AndiolaPolitical DirectorOur Revolution-----Paid for by Our RevolutionNOT AUTHORIZED BY ANY CANDIDATE OR CANDIDATE COMMITTEE.

We kept Republican senators'phone lines so jammed that one Utahn resorted to sendingSen.

SpinelessCongressional Republicans have supported Trump's shamefuland poorly-planned executive orders and disastrouslyunqualified Cabinet picks. We just saw them vote in lockstepto confirm Jeff Sessions -- who was considered by the Senateto be too racist to be a federal judge in 1986 -- as AttorneyGeneral. They are a doormat for the Trump administration towalk over -- even though Trump's approval ratings are lowerthan those of any other new president in history.Because of the GOP's cowardice, our system of checks andbalances is compromised -- and in order to fix it, weneed to help Democrats win back control of Congress.If you're ready to put a stop to Trump's Republican Party,pitch in $3 or whatever you can right now so we can startbuilding the tools and infrastructure that it will take toelect Democrats in 2018: so much,EricEric WalkerDeputy Communications DirectorDemocratic National Committee **************************************************************Paid for by the Democratic National Committee,  430 South Capitol Street SE, Washington DC 20003 and not authorized by any candidate or candidate\u2019s committee.

        "email_content": "Friend --The last 24 hours have raised serious national security concerns -- and this is just the beginning.Not only have we learned more about Michael Flynn's secret contacts with Russia, but we also learned that Donald Trump was aware his National Security Advisor was lying and he still chose not to act. At least, not until it became a PR problem.This is a time to put country before politics. Nothing less than the national security of this country is at stake.It's time for Republicans to stand aside and support a full investigation into the Trump team's ties to Russia. Will you join us in calling for an independent investigation?ADD YOUR NAME:  truth is, Michael Flynn's resignation raises more questions than it answers.Did this Trump loyalist really go rogue and reach out to the Russians to discuss U.S. sanctions without consulting his superiors?Did Russia really believe General Flynn had full authority to speak for the Trump administration? Or was Moscow in contact with other Trump officials?After the Justice Department warned the White House three weeks ago that Flynn could be compromised by a foreign power, how could other officials remain in the dark about Flynn's conversations with Russia?And most importantly, what did President Trump know and when did he know it?Friend, will you add your name to stand with Senate Democrats who are calling for an independent investigation into Trump's connections with Russia?ADD YOUR NAME:                               At a minimum, this affair shows that the White House chain of command is alarmingly unprepared to guard our national security. But darker still, it raises the possibility that Flynn is a scapegoat who resigned to protect others who were fully aware of his actions.In either case, the American people deserve immediate action to know.Will you add your name to stand with us? you for standing up for our democracy,Chris Van HollenDSCC ChairDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee120 Maryland Ave. NEWashington, DC 20002Paid for by DSCC, dscc.org,and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.The DSCC is the only committee solely dedicated to supporting Democrats in the U.S. Senate.

The math is simple: Republicans need to get to a filibuster-proof, 60-seat Senate majority in order to ram through their radical right-wing agenda. They can't get to 60 if they don't knock out Joe.That means that Joe Donnelly is standing in the way of the Trump/McConnell agenda. And that's where you come in.Joe is facing a $35,000 fundraising deadline by the end of the month. Make a $5 grassroots contribution today to Joe's Senate Defense Fund, and your gift will be MATCHED.  attacks on Joe have already started -- coming from special interest groups like Trump's Make America Great PAC. And they're not going to stop until the polls close next November. We can't stop the attacks -- what we can do is organize on the ground and fight back. Joe is ready for this fight. He's been attacked by Republicans and right-wing groups for a long time. They want to defeat Joe because he fights for our values. He's proven that by working to protect DACA recipients from deportation, standing against Trump's most extreme Cabinet nominees, and joining protesters to speak out against Trump's refugee ban and his disastrous attempt to take away people's health care.What Joe's team needs are the resources to fight back -- online, on air, and on the ground. We need him in Washington much more than Trump and McConnell want him gone.We can beat back the attacks that are already coming -- but only if we meet our fundraising goals.

Yesterday, our president said our country needs a shutdown. And I am outraged.Does President Trump understand what a government shutdown would mean? Because I'll tell you right now: Thousands of government employees would go without wages. Children will be turned away from their field trips to hundreds of national parks, museums, and zoos. Government loans to businesses could be delayed.And why doesn't President Trump think about that? Because he doesn't think about working people. He thinks about his wealthy friends who won't be affected. But we can't let him get away with doing real damage to real people's lives.A government shutdown is not a tool to further Republicans' agenda. It is the result of the GOP choosing to play politics over settling on a budget that will help American families. But President Trump thinks that their inability to create an acceptable budget is a reason to elect more Republicans to the Senate.You know what I think? I think this is a sign we need to keep the seats we have, and we have to hold onto them stronger than ever. We should come out of this with a budget that puts our priorities first. And that's what Democratic Senators have been pushing for -- a bipartisan spending bill that invests in working people's health care instead of shutting down the government for partisan reasons. And that's why I'm asking for you to support them today.Donate today -- let's keep the people who want our government to keep running in office. you for doing your part to keep us moving forward.Sincerely,Chuck SchumerCONTRIBUTE > > Senatorial Campaign Committee120 Maryland Ave. NEWashington, DC 20002Paid for by DSCC, dscc.org,and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.The DSCC is the only committee solely dedicated to supporting Democrats in the U.S. Senate.

Click here to apply  .Health Care UpdateSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled the latest version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act on Thursday. As Senator McConnell and others said, the initial bill was a 'discussion draft' and this revamped legislation includes some important provisions that have been included based on those discussions. These additions include:More Help to Cover Out-of-Pocket Costs: An additional $70 billion is dedicated to encouraging state-based reforms, which could include help with driving down premiums through cost-sharing, Health Savings Accounts HSA, and other innovative ideas to help pay for health care costs. This is in addition to the $112 billion in funding already in the original bill.Health Savings Accounts to Pay for Premiums: In order to ensure that more people have financial support to pay for health care costs, a provision has been included in the bill that would, for the first time, allow people to use their HSAs to pay for their premiums.  This is a policy that both the Joint Committee on Taxation JCT and the Congressional Budget Office CBO say will increase health care coverage.Additional Resources to Combat the Opioid Epidemic: With the opioid crisis hitting Americans in every state, an additional $45 billion is dedicated for substance abuse treatment and recovery.News You Can UseSecretary of State Connie Lawson assumes presidency of National Association of Secretaries of State  Kelly Mitchell helps Indiana Diary at their Ice Cream Social on the Circle  Todd Young highlights Indiana's incredible work fighting human trafficking  Jackie Walorski says small businesses need tax reform  Jim Banks speaks about 'urgent and imminent threat' posed by North Korea  Todd Rokita calls on Congress to postpone August Recess  Susan Brooks' weekly #WhatImHearing video on the opioid crisis  Luke Messer proposal to help vets impacted by ITT Tech closure one step closer to law  Larry Bucshon discusses the drug epidemic on the House Floor  Trey Hollingsworth posts photos from his District Work Week travel  CalendarSaturday, July 15  - Fayette County GOP Hog Roast/BBQSaturday, August 5  - Annual Buck Garden PartyFriday, August 11  - IFRW Tribute to Women DinnerSaturday, August 12  - IFRW State ConventionThursday, August 17  - Perry-Spencer Republican PicnicSaturday, August 19  - Adams County 2nd Annual Benjamin Harrison BreakfastSaturday, August 19  - Clay County GOP Handgun Raffle & Pie AuctionSaturday, August 19  - Grillin' & Chillin' at the Brown County GOP BBQFriday, August 25  - Grant County GOP Golf Scramble============================================================**   Share    Tweet    Forward      mailto:info@indiana.gopThis email was sent to  mailto:why did I get this?      unsubscribe from this list      update subscription preferences  Republican State Committee, Inc. . 101 W.

Those are his words.Corey is prepared to go straight to the gutter in his campaign, with lies, nastiness and constant negativity.This is the opposite of the Tim we know. He fights for children's cancer research, jobs for veterans, career and technical education, shipbuilding, opioid treatment, a cleaner Chesapeake Bay and good health care for folks in every part of the Commonwealth. He's deeply respected by his Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle.And he does it with an upbeat and can-do spirit that reflects the goodness of Virginians.Upbeat and positive versus \"vicious and ruthless.\" That's a real choice.Can you support Tim's positive vision for our Commonwealth and country?

        "email_content": "Team --Thirty-eight years ago today, I was born to my mother Frances, a bus driver, and my daddy Charles, a construction worker in Miami, Florida.They didn't know that their son would go on to become the youngest City Commissioner in Tallahassee's history. Or that he'd later become Mayor. Or that he'd run for Governor.All they knew was that they loved me, and they wanted to give me the best opportunities they could. They didn't give me a famous last name or millions of dollars in wealth. They gave me love -- and a chance.Today, I'm running to become Governor of Florida to honor what my parents gave me on my first birthday - a chance to do well and get ahead.And I've tried to take that chance whenever it's presented itself.When I was in the 7th grade, I didn't think I belonged in honors classes at Westwood Middle School in Gainesville. My language arts teacher, Ms. Alexandria, encouraged me to sign up for them, but I wasn't sure I belonged. None of my older siblings had ever graduated from high school, let alone taken an honors class. But she insisted -- and ultimately persisted -- in getting me to take that chance.When I first ran for City Commission, the cynics and critics told me I was too young and too inexperienced. That I needed to wait my turn and one day they might decide it was my turn. But all I asked for in that campaign was a chance - and the wonderful people of Tallahassee granted me one.And today - on my birthday - all I'm asking for is a chance.A chance to help change Florida for the better. A chance to help working families in every corner of our state make ends meet. A chance for every person to have access to a job with dignity. A chance for every person to have access to affordable and quality healthcare as a right. A chance to help every student get a high-quality public education.Will you help give me this chance to serve the state of Florida by chipping in to our campaign for Governor today?  we continue on this journey, I hope you'll join me so we can give every Floridian the opportunity they need to succeed and live a fulfilled life - no matter your race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, class, age, ability, or background.So as I celebrate my birthday today, I want you to help me give every Floridian what I got on my first birthday - a real chance.Bring it home,Andrew----This email was sent to .To unsubscribe, go to:   "

        "email_content": "   Friend,Last week we witnessed another torrent of alarming developments from President Trump and his White House. We saw more outrageous White House staff turmoil, inappropriate Presidential remarks to the Boy Scouts, the New York Police, and on Twitter, and little evidence that anyone at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is adequately focused on the very real threats facing our country including, but not limited to, the deteriorating situation in North Korea. Almost lost in all the noise was the breaking news that President Trump had dictated his son's misleading statements regarding his June 2016 meeting with Russian representatives -- a meeting that we subsequently learned was about Russian interest in helping Trump in his presidential campaign.  This is the closest evidence of Presidential involvement in a Russia coverup that we have seen to date. At the same time, the President has repeatedly hinted that he might try to remove the person conducting the investigation into any collusion or coverup -- Special Prosecutor, Robert Mueller. We need to build a firewall between this White House and Special Prosecutor Mueller's investigation and prevent more Trump firings.   Join me in demanding that Republicans help us block any Presidential appointments while the Senate is in recess in August.Trump and his surrogates have been openly attacking special prosecutor Robert Mueller -- a lifelong Republican and former Director of the FBI -- painting him as tainted by partisanship despite all evidence to the contrary. When it became clear that these smear tactics were gaining no traction, Trump began to go after his own Attorney General for recusing himself from the investigation and eliminating any possibility of using his position to interfere on behalf of the President.Time and time again, President Trump has made it perfectly clear that he has no qualms about firing people to thwart investigations into his misdeeds. We cannot afford to underestimate the actions he is prepared to take to stop this inquiry.Join me in calling on my colleagues in the House and Senate to protect Robert Mueller from White House intervention and allow the investigation to continue >>Chris Van HollenU.S. SenatorPaid for by Van Hollen for US SenateYou're receiving this email at: If you'd like to unsubscribe visit:  "

These individuals were brought to our country as minors and know America as the country they love. They live here, work here, contribute to our communities, and many have started families here. They fulfill jobs that are crucial to our communities in fields like health care, computer science, and emergency services. Before DACA, millions were living in the shadows, afraid of being deported to a country that they've never known.  DACA brought them into the light and America has benefitted as a result. Our country is stronger and our economy is growing thanks to their efforts. All of that might end this September. Republican Attorneys General have given President Trump until September 5th to overturn DACA or else they will sue his administration.  If that happens, more than 750,000 hardworking, law-abiding Americans will face deportation to a country they don't know.  Families will be ripped apart. Our country will lose some of our most brilliant minds. Local communities will go without doctors, nurses, engineers, and so much more. We can't allow that to happen. Please, sign your name and demand President Trump protect DACA.  can and must do better for our DREAMers. Take action before it's too late.

If you mention Tim to anyone who knows him, whether it's a member of his church congregation who sang with him in the choir or a Republican senator who works with him across the aisle, you're likely to hear the same thing: Tim is a guy who believes in love and kindness. I'm proud to call Tim and Anne my friends, and I'm doing all I can to support Tim in his reelection campaign. Will you join me? Here's the thing: Losing the election was hard -- for all of us. It's also hard to keep mustering the energy to continue fighting, day after day, for the America we still believe in. But what would be hardest of all is giving up.Tim is someone who never gives up. When we lost in November, he didn't even take a vacation -- he went right back to work for Virginians in the Senate. For Tim, there was no rest for the weary. Guided by his love of this country and his care for the people he serves, he knew he had to continue to fight for what's right -- for Virginians and all Americans -- inch by inch, tooth and nail, no matter the obstacle. And now, more than ever, that's what we need in the Senate. So today, I'm asking you to help make sure we keep him there.Please join me in supporting Tim's campaign by pitching in $10 or whatever you can right now. Tim and I are both guided by faith, and during the campaign, we always reminded one another of this creed: Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.Let's make sure Tim can keep doing good for Virginia families in the Senate.

And that they have a HUGE impact on our elections?Secretaries of state are usually responsible for making sure elections are fair and transparent, coordinating the ballots for statewide elections, and processing your voter registration.It's a tall order, but all this and more are part of the job.Because secretaries of state have far-reaching effects on our democracy, we're endorsing four strong progressive champions running for this office: Kathleen Clyde OH, Nellie Gorbea RI, Jena Griswold CO, and Maggie Toulouse Oliver NM.Donate $3 to help elect these four women running for secretary of state and support pro-choice Democratic women running across the country: pro-choice Democratic women to state legislatures, governors' seats, Congress, and the White House are all essential -- but secretaries of state can affect your right to even vote in those elections in the first place.Republicans have used this powerful office to attack voting rights for years by making it harder for low-income Americans, the elderly, young people, and people of color to vote by purging voter rolls, closing voting locations, and other tricks.We need Kathleen, Nellie, Jena, and Maggie in office fighting to protect our voting rights from ruthless Republican attacks and making sure elections are free and fair. And you can count on us to endorse even more women running for this critical office in the months to come.Because these races don't get the most attention, a little money from us can go a LONG way to help them win.Donate $3 to help elect our four newly endorsed secretary of state candidates and women running for state and local office across the country: GuinnVice President of Campaigns, EMILY's List----This email was sent to .To unsubscribe, go to:    or gifts to EMILY's List or endorsed candidates are not tax deductible.Paid for by EMILY's List, www.emilyslist.org, and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee."

We've been through quite a few of these elections together. If you asked Debbie what her \"toughest challenge\" is, she'd probably say something like protecting health care for Florida families. Or stopping the Trump administration from destroying all the progress of the past eight years. Those are the things she focuses on -- the things that improve lives and bring stability to the people who elected her. But look, Debbie is up against four opponents. They're fundraising well and already coming after her. So our challenge is mustering the resources we need right now to be prepared for whatever comes our way. We can't skimp on that responsibility. The deadline to reach the $25,000 October goal is Tuesday. Please, if you can, chip in $ASK or more. I know Debbie will appreciate it.  always, always has our backs. That's true with her family and in her work. Let's make sure we don't let her down.

This week, I was honored to earn the endorsements of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Virginian-Pilot, and the Winchester Star. These endorsements come from a proven record of experience and ability to lead, as well as our campaign's positive policy vision for making Virginia the best state in the nation to live, work, and raise a family.

The plan lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle-income Americans, eliminates special-interest deductions, and repeals the death tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. \u201cIt\u2019s tax cuts, it\u2019s tax reform, and we added the word \u2018jobs\u2019 because it\u2019s all about jobs,\u201d said President Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have tremendous numbers of jobs pouring in.\u201d   Read President Trump's statement  on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and  sign your name to support tax reform. Bringing Jobs Home to America In the Oval Office yesterday, President Trump announced that Fortune 100 tech company Broadcom Limited is moving its headquarters to the United States. The company is currently based in Singapore and employs over 7,500 American workers. Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom Limited, said the decision to relocate Broadcam was driven by his \u201cdesire to give back to this country that has given me so much.\" The move will bring more than $20 billion in annual revenue back to the U.S.\"My administration is working every day to make the United States the most attractive place in the world to do business,\" said President Trump, \u201cso that more and more companies like Broadcom come back to our shores, grow their businesses, and create more and more American jobs. And you see that happening on a daily basis.\u201d See the full announcement  here . President Trump Announces Fed Chair Nominee  On Thursday afternoon in the Rose Garden, President Trump announced his nomination of Governor Jerome \u201cJay\u201d H. Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Governor Powell was selected by the President because of his professional experience, commitment to sound monetary and financial policy, and strong record of independent judgement.  Governor Powell has been a Federal Reserve board member since 2012 and has built a reputation as an effective and well-respected policymaker who has the judgment and experience necessary to lead the Federal Reserve. He previously served as Undersecretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush.    See more from the announcement  here.  Photo of the Day President Donald J.

Governor-elect Justin Fairfax, and Attorney General Mark Herring win Tuesday's elections here in Virginia. These victories, along with the 15 Virginia House of Delegates seats we flipped and major wins across the country, are the direct result of what happens when Democrats work together to win. I can't overstate how thrilled my wife, Dorothy, and I are knowing we get to pass the baton to a family that will fight to protect our progress and work tirelessly for even more. I know that Ralph and Justin will continue our hard work -- keeping our unemployment rate low while creating more jobs, further expanding access to affordable health care and the ballot box, and continuing to give our teachers everything they'll need to prepare our children for the future. That's what happens when more Democrats win. We can take what the Democratic National Committee did in Virginia nationwide in 2018, Derek. And we should.

Get a huge \"Women's Senate Network\" tattoo.\"Um, how about let's start with a fundraising email?\" they suggested.  Good idea.Please click here to make a contribution to the Women's Senate Network to support the TEN Democratic women senators on the ballot in 2018! if you are a keen political observer, you will notice that I am not, myself, a woman.  So why is the Women's Senate Network so important to me?  Three reasons.1. The ten Democratic women up for re-election next year represent nearly half of all women in the Senate.  And the last thing we need around here is to have fewer women in positions of power.2. The Republican plan for growing their majority and ramming through more of President Trump's far-right agenda revolves around taking out as many of these women as they can -- in fact, several are already facing attack ads.3. These women aren't just Democratic votes -- they're Democratic leaders, including dynamic progressive champions like Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin, tough-as-nails fighters like Claire McCaskill and Mazie Hirono, and even Amy Klobuchar: my senior senator, my role model, and one of the smartest, hardest-working, and okay, I'll admit it funniest people in Washington.Imagine what the Senate would be like without these women, and you'll understand why we can't afford to lose any of these incredible leaders.Will you help me help them by making a contribution to support the Women's Senate Network today? I know all about tough races.  But there's no denying that the other side makes it even harder on women who dare to step up and run.  Those who do it anyway -- and win -- often wind up being some of our most indispensable leaders: tough, smart, courageous Democrats who never back down from a fight.It's also why it's so important that we stand with them right now.  We've never had an election where so many Democratic women are under attack -- and the truth is, 2018 is shaping up to be an even tougher-than-usual year to be on the ballot.So I hope you'll join me in support of the Women's Senate Network by clicking here and making a contribution right now.  Especially because Franni tells me the tattoo idea is a non-starter. I'm going to do everything I can to stand with these ten awesome women - and I hope you are, too.  A great way to start would be to click here and help support the Women's Senate Network today!

Pundits and political forecasters are already predicting this race will cost upwards of $100 million. One even ranked it as \"Leans Republican\" -- they think Joe's the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the Senate.\u2028Extreme special interest groups have read those rankings, and they've already flooded the airwaves with millions of dollars worth of ads to try and smear Joe. Countering their attacks will require the most robust media plan in the country.

        "email_content": "Republicans want to end the investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia ties. We cannot let them.   The petition to congressional leadership reads:\u201cThe congressional investigation into Trump cannot conclude until Special Prosecutor Mueller has wrapped up his investigation.\u201d \u00a0Add your name:      Dear Activist,   Republicans have sought every chance to delegitimize special counsel Robert Mueller. Now, they are ramping up their attempts to derail Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Trump\u2019s Russia ties with calls to shut down the parallel, ongoing congressional investigations, thus making it appear as if Mueller is on a wild goose chase.1Republicans have spent months stymying the investigation by refusing to schedule interviews with key witnesses and sitting on requests from Democrats to subpoena relevant documents. Now powerful House Republican leaders such as Rep. Trey Gowdy \u2013 an extreme right-wing Republican ideologue \u2013 are reportedly talking about shutting down the investigation.2 This is unacceptable.Trump\u2019s lapdogs in Congress are making up excuses to conclude their investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia ties to pressure Mueller to end his investigation \u2013 and shut down Democrats like Rep. Adam Schiff who have relentlessly pursued the truth. We need a large outcry right now to shame Republicans into continuing their investigation.Tell congressional leaders: Don\u2019t bow to Trump by ending the Russia investigation. Click here to sign the petition.  There is no way congressional investigators have actually finished their work. No one yet knows the full extent of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, and special counsel Mueller keeps uncovering new information that warrants congressional investigation.Republicans are sabotaging an investigation with national security implications. House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes repeatedly refused requests from his Democratic colleagues for interviews with as many as 30 witnesses and blocked potential subpoenas of relevant documents.3 Financial crimes are notoriously difficult to uncover, and thorough investigations can take years.4It is evident the investigation to date has not been sufficiently thorough. Democratic Congressman Jim Himes says that there are so many unanswered questions that Democrats would have to list them in a minority report if Republicans get their way. 5Mueller and the congressional investigators have two different jobs. Mueller\u2019s narrow focus is on whether anyone connected to the Trump organization \u2013 or Trump himself \u2013 committed specific crimes by coordinating with Russians. Congress is investigating Russia\u2019s attempt to hijack our democracy and whether Trump or his campaign engaged in shameful and improper collusion with Russia even if it does not violate specific laws. Congress\u2019 responsibility is to ensure thorough fact finding to uncover answers for the American public. Republicans are refusing to get the real facts in a bid to undermine Robert Mueller, and we cannot let that happen.Tell congressional leaders: Don\u2019t bow to Trump by ending the Russia investigation. Click here to sign the petition.  The effort to derail Mueller began among fringe supporters and the alt-right fake news, but Trump Republicans are now blatantly launching a systematic and coordinated attack on his investigation. The current Republican attempts to end the ongoing congressional investigations are part of an alliance with the extreme right-wing and Trump sycophants in Congress to systematically undermine Mueller and his investigation.6 By insisting that there are no other questions to ask, or evidence to examine, Republicans hope to create a media firestorm from the extreme right wing that will either shut down or sabotage Mueller\u2019s investigation.The public has a right to know the extent of the potential collusion between Trump and his associates and the Kremlin. As long as there are witnesses to interview, and questions remain, Congress must keep up this crucial work.Tell congressional leaders: Don\u2019t bow to Trump by ending Russia investigation.

And one that Conor Lamb embodies.A Marine Corps officer. A federal prosecutor. Conor has committed himself to public service.Now Conor is running in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District and I'm hoping you'll join me in supporting him and making a donation here to his campaign for Congress. 18th is in western Pennsylvania. It's a place where, as Conor says, \"People have always gone to work, often at an early age, and often with their hands. It's where our parents and grandparents built the bridges and roads that built this country. And then built the businesses that had trucks drive over them.\"Conor Lamb will be a strong voice for working people. He's not afraid to say the word \"union\" -- and more importantly, he's not afraid to stand up for organized labor.Conor knows that teachers and nurses and cops and construction workers deserve someone who will stand up for them in Congress. But that's not enough. They deserve someone who respects them, values what they do, and thanks them for the service they give every day to their community, their state, and this nation, too.I hope you'll join me in supporting Conor Lamb and making a donation here to his campaign for Congress.

Before the summit, the Vice President will meet with Venezuelan opposition leaders at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador in Peru.     Mike Pompeo is the top diplomat America needs  CIA Director Mike Pompeo believes that leadership is about results. And for the past 14 months, those results have been exemplary. From pressuring North Korea to dismantling ISIS, some of the Trump Administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy accomplishments wouldn\u2019t have been possible without CIA support under the watch of Director Pompeo. Pompeo\u2019s successes come from proven experience. He has been privy to some of America\u2019s toughest national security challenges since 2010, when he served on the House Intelligence Committee as a freshman member of Congress. He\u2019s had stints as a U.S. Cavalry officer, an entrepreneur, an executive\u2014even as Editor of Harvard Law Review. His storied career adds up to one certainty: Mike Pompeo will be ready to lead the State Department on day one. With the grave threats facing our country, America needs him as our next Secretary of State. More:  Why Mike Pompeo is the leader America needs as its top diplomat    Tax cuts are energizing employers of all sizes  President Trump shared big news from the Rose Garden yesterday. Optimism among American manufacturers has reached unprecedented levels, according to a new survey from a leading industry group. Manufacturer optimism stood at 93.5 percent, the second highest reading in the survey\u2019s history. Even better news is what that means for workers. The same survey showed that manufacturers anticipate wages will grow at the fastest pace in 17 years. \u201cAll you used to hear is that we\u2019re losing our manufacturing jobs; jobs are being taken out of the country,\u201d President Trump said yesterday. \u201cThey\u2019re coming back and they\u2019re coming back fast.\u201d Other major reports tell the same story. Small businesses across sectors are worrying less about taxes and are investing more in their workers, according to a National Federation of Independent Businesses survey last month. And Ernst & Young reports that 89 percent of executives say their companies plan to increase worker compensation as a result of tax cuts.  See how President Trump\u2019s tax cuts are energizing American employers of all sizes.     Photo of the Day  Official White House Photo by Andrea Hanks  President Donald J.

If you believe in the power of progressives to fight for tax fairness, create good-paying jobs and grow Maryland's economy, can you chip in $5 to our campaign today? families are already struggling with wages that aren't rising fast enough while paying more and more for their healthcare and housing. The last thing they need is a tax increase.Republicans have decided to put permanent tax cuts for massive corporations ahead of protecting real American people, and this will not stand.We can and must do better.

With the help of tens of thousands of folks just like you, we won -- and Hoosiers sent one of the hardest-working people I've ever met to represent them in the Senate.Now Joe needs your help again. Indiana's 2018 Senate contest will be one of the tightest races in the country, so it's critical that Joe knows you're on his side. Will you add your name to show him you support his re-election campaign? >> in 2012, I signed up to run Joe's campaign because it was clear to me that Indiana needed an independent voice in the Senate who would fight for working Hoosier families -- and that's exactly what we got in Joe. Just take a look at his record:He defended health care access for working families.He opposed Mitch McConnell's disastrous tax plan.He's protecting Social Security & Medicare for retirees.But Peter, it could all be for nothing if McConnell and the Koch brothers have their way. Joe is facing a flood of special interest money, and it's only going to get worse -- especially once Republicans choose their candidate in just three weeks.Just like in 2012, Joe isn't relying on special interest money for support -- he's relying on people like you, the hard-working folks he fights for in the Senate. Add your name -- Joe's in the fight of his political life and he needs to know you're with him. is going to be a tough campaign. But it'll be worth it to keep a hardworking down-to-earth guy like Joe fighting for Hoosiers in the Senate.Thanks,Paul TencherCONTRIBUTE:  for by Donnelly for Indiana-------This email was sent to DPWILLIS67@GMAIL.COM.To unsubscribe, go to:"

I have long supported a bipartisan approach to fixing it, and I'm still hopeful that we can work together to get it done.But the separation of young children from their parents at the border requires immediate action. That's why I cosponsored S. 3036, the Keep Families Together Act.I hope you will join me in continuing to voice your opposition to the cruel policy of family separation as we work toward a solution.

I'm taking action. Add your name if you're with me. same prohibitions that bar an individual from buying a gun also prohibit ammunition purchases, but there is no verification. I have introduced legislation to require anyone buying ammunition to pass the same background check as anyone buying a gun, with no loopholes. This bill will help to keep bullets out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them. And while no single law will stop every tragedy, this is exactly the kind of common-sense idea that could make a big difference. We owe it to our children to give them a leader concerned with safety and education, not profits. Betsy DeVos is not the answer.

The mass incarceration of children is immoral. This must end.And yet our current Congressman has done nothing to alleviate this gross injustice but offer hollow words of disappointment.

It's a responsible and bipartisan plan that I'm proud to support.After fully restoring the massive education cuts made in the previous administration, we're now investing an additional $190 million in public education so that we can make sure that our children are getting the best education possible to succeed. And businesses only want to invest in states that invest in their future.We have also dedicated additional $70 million to fund school safety programs that are critical to protecting our children.Our budget also includes a first-of-its-kind $30 million strategic investment in job training and workforce development so students and workers gain the 21st century skills to get good jobs that employers demand.But listen, let me remind you that our fight is far from over.Over the past three years, we've been able to accomplish so much together. Now that this year's budget is complete, it is imperative that we all continue to work together to focus on moving Pennsylvania in the right direction.Since day one, I've promised to change Harrisburg by prioritizing issues important to Pennsylvania families. That's what we've been able to do with this budget.

Elections are not won the week or two before votes are cast - Voters are making their decisions NOW. The urgency of the election is growing.I must make the case that I am the most conservative and best candidate to defeat Claire McCaskill in November. Voters must learn that Hawley is a fake conservative and not prepared for prime time. We have more volunteers, donors, and Name ID than ever before. We produce earned media and are reaching thousands of voters every day.Next month, I will take the hammer to Josh Hawley\u2019s campaign. Every GOP primary voter in Missouri will know that I am the real conservative and Hawley is a Mitch McConnell puppet.To do this we will run ads online, radio and T.V. to reach everyone possible.So what\u2019s next?I\u2019ll be honest with you.I need you to make your first online donation to the campaign.Friend, I need absolutely everyone onboard. I don\u2019t care if you can donate $5 or $500. I am asking you to donate literally any amount to the campaign.I have put my entire life on hold to run for Senate because I know how incredibly important it is that we fire Claire, and I am ready to serve. I know I can beat her. I\u2019m putting in the work. I just need you to chip in, and I will make you proud.It is not enough to be a conservative, libertarian, or simply be correct on the issues. We have to do something about it. We owe it to our philosophy and our principles to win. And victory is impossible without your help. < use one of these links to donate anything you can afford:Donate $10 Here >>> < $20.18 Here >>> < $35 Here >>> < $50 Here >>> < $100 Here >>> < $500 Here >>> < Any Amount Here >>> < let me tell you something\u2026I am all in.

I am doing everything it takes to win this campaign - but I need your help, and we need it right now.Please consider making your first donation to the campaign today. Let it not be said we did nothing to restore our Republic.Thank you,Austin PetersenP.S. I am setting an ambitious goal this month. I would like to find 1,500 online donors before the end of the month. I know that\u2019s a lot. But I am confident we can reach it. We need to.Please become one of those first donors.

It was about building a movement and creating a   political revolution. Here is the very good news. In the last two years,   we have made enormous progress in achieving that goal.   First, the progressive agenda that we have supported is now the agenda of   the American people. On issue after issue whether it is health care for   all, raising the minimum wage, pay equity for women, rebuilding our   crumbling infrastructure, making public colleges and universities   tuition-free, transforming our energy system, immigration reform, criminal   justice reform and many other issues, poll after poll shows the American   people are now solidly with us. They want, we want, public policies that   represent the needs of all the American people, not just the 1 percent.   Secondly, not only are we winning the ideological debate, we are also   making enormous progress in creating the political movement we need to   implement that agenda. All over this country working people and young   people are becoming engaged in the political process, are running for   office, and oftentimes they are winning. Just in the last couple of weeks   great candidates like Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar pulled off major upsets   and will become some of the most progressive members of Congress. Wesley   Bell pulled off another great upset in Missouri and will become the   prosecutor in St. Louis County where Ferguson is located. James Thompson   won the Democratic nomination for Congress in Wichita, Kansas, and Randy   Bryce, a union ironworker, won his primary and now stands a good chance of   becoming the congressman from Paul Ryan\u2019s very own district.   In other words, despite what you may read in the corporate media or hear   from the \u201cpunditry,\u201d the political revolution is gaining momentum. But we   still have a long way to go. There are three great candidates running for   governor, all of whom are strong progressives and have a real shot at   winning if they have adequate resources.   That is why tomorrow I am heading to Florida to help Andrew Gillum win his   race for governor. Andrew is running his campaign on progressive ideas   like Medicare for all, repealing Stand Your Ground laws, banning assault   weapons, legalizing marijuana and a $15/hr minimum wage.   There are also two other candidates who need our help: Ben Jealous, who   with our support won his primary and now faces a tough fight to win the   governorship of Maryland. There are very few individuals I know running   for any office who have the lifetime record of progressivism that Ben   does.   And I am supporting Stacey Abrams who is running an extremely important   campaign in Georgia. If elected, she will defeat a right-wing extremist   and become the first African-American woman ever elected governor of any   state in the history of our country.   All three of these campaigns face unique challenges \u2014 all three are at a   financial disadvantage against their opponents. All three can use our help   to close that gap. So I am asking:   [  ]Can you split a   $3 donation   between Andrew Gillum's, Ben Jealous' and Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaigns for   governor and my work traveling the country rallying and organizing   progressive victories ahead of this November\u2019s critical elections?   Sisters and Brothers, we live in an unprecedented moment in American   history, and we need an unprecedented response. Together \u2013 black, white,   Latino, Native American, Asian American, women and men, gay and straight,   young and old \u2013 we must not allow Donald Trump and his supporters to   divide us up while they pass legislation to protect the 1 percent.   Because when we stand together as one people, united, fighting for a   progressive agenda, there is nothing, nothing, nothing that we cannot   accomplish.   Andrew Gillum, Ben Jealous and Stacey Abrams are fighting for that   progressive agenda, and I am proud to support their campaigns. I hope that   you will as well:   Make a $3   donation to Andrew Gillum's, Ben Jealous' and Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaigns for   governor today:   [  ]   Victories for these three great candidates will change America in a very   significant way. Thank you for standing with them.   In solidarity,   Bernie Sanders                                   [  ]DONATE      You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:"

WhileI\u2019m working to alleviate students from the burdens of schooldebt, DeVos\u2019s actions are aiding lenders, not students and theirfutures.With back-to-school season in full swing, we want to hearfrom you: Do you think that students should be protected frompredatory and fraudulent loan servicers?YES   NO   When students make the decision to go to college, theyshouldn\u2019t have to fear that the institutions in place to helpthem will actually try to scam them.DeVos should be working for students, not for those whoactively engage in predatory behavior.Thanks for helping me stand up for our students.DanThanks for your support of our campaign.Contributions or gifts to Lipinski for Congress are not taxdeductible.-----------------------------------------------|    Paid for by Dan Lipinski for Congress    |----------------------------------------------- Lipinski for CongressP.O.

But that shouldn't detract from the progress that is being made despite his chaos.I have been leading the conversation on cybersecurity and the threats we face from foreign hackers. Beyond our election infrastructure, our energy grids and transportation systems are also susceptible to hacking attacks, with potentially disastrous consequences. We secured $380 million for election security earlier this year, and my amendment to establish a national cyber warfare doctrine passed the Senate earlier this month.I've also been fighting to protect investments in our rural transportation infrastructure in New Mexico. The Senate recently passed my bipartisan amendment for an additional $50 million to help maintain the Southwest Chief Amtrak route. Trains help connect New Mexico to the rest of the country, and keeping this route is critical to the local economy and the rural communities that rely on this line.And I'm standing up to President Trump's cynical attempt to force consumers to bailout uncompetitive coal and nuclear power plants. In a blatant effort to keep his campaign promises, the president is claiming a national security emergency to keep coal-fired plants open. But the truth is there is no national security emergency, and this artificial bailout will increase energy costs and leave businesses and households paying higher electric bills. I am going to keep fighting against this bailout and any attempt to drag us back on energy, and I will continue to push for modernizing and diversifying our energy grid.Some of these updates don't warrant a breaking news alert on your phone, but they are making a difference in people's lives. I came to the Senate to represent New Mexicans and our values, and we are making progress that will help people across our state and country.That is why I am asking for your support today. I am in my first Senate re-election race, and all this hard work and more will be undone if one of my extreme right-wing opponents defeats me this November. To make sure that doesn't happen, we need to reach our weekend fundraising goal by bringing in $5,000 in grassroots donations. Will you pitch in and help me reach this goal before the midnight deadline?  for all you do,MartinPAID FOR BY MARTIN HEINRICH FOR SENATEIf you would like to unsubscribe from these emails click "

Now, we're facing our first realfundraising test since Johnson entered the race.Sunday is the last quarterly FEC deadline before theelection, and afterwards I will have to report my fundraisingnumbers for the first time since Johnson challenged me.

And when you work in freezers making ice cream for a living, it feels just a little bit colder. So it takes a lot to get me out of Vermont in the summer and fall -- but for Ben Jealous, it's worth it. That's why I was back in Maryland to talk to voters about why this election matters so much, and why I think my friend Ben is the best candidate for governor. His campaign is run on small donations and ice cream, of course, so he depends on the support of folks like you. I've donated up to the legal limit for Ben, will you join me in making a grassroots donation of $5 or more today?  Ben is fighting a system that has been rigged to benefit the wealthy and the powerful. And it's about time we get a democracy that works for the many. Not just the few. In this time of Trumpian destruction of everything we believe in -- in this time of \"me first, screw you\" -- people of conscience who understand the rhetoric he puts out have got to stand up and resist. Ben's opponent may be resisting a little, but he's not doing it with his heart and soul. I met Ben when I was arrested with him resisting big money in politics. That's how I know he's the right person to lead Maryland forward -- because he risks everything to resist tyranny. Unlike Larry Hogan, Ben doesn't have the windfall of big corporate money -- it's donations from real people that are going to put him over the finish line. Trust me, he's depending on you now: Donate $5 or more to show your support today.Thanks,Ben Cohen FOR BY FRIENDS OF BEN JEALOUS, JASON SMALL, TREASURERThis email was sent to .

It's time for him to pack it up and come home.I was feeling really good, until Tori told me that we're not likely to hit our Debate Day goal. We still have a few hours to get to our 500 supporter goal before midnight. Can you give ASAP? get to work! Kathy ---------- Forwarded message ----------From: Kathy ManningSubject: What are you up to tonight?I will be facing Rep. Ted Budd in my first debate tonight.While I share my vision for North Carolina, Ted Budd will certainly be doing rhetorical gymnastics to defend his special interest-first agenda.We're setting up a Debate Day goal to show how many of us are fighting against the Budd agenda. WIll you be one of the 500 supporters we need to give before midnight? Any amount will get us closer to that goal.  and his special interest allies are spending huge sums of money against me. It averages out to tens of thousands of dollars a day. But you know what? None of that spending will help Ted Budd on that debate stage tonight. When you're at a podium answering questions, you can't hide behind attack ads. Your special interest allies can't grab the microphone and answer for you. Tonight, it's Budd, me, a moderator, and our ideas. I can't wait. Of course, once I'm out of the debate, all that spending comes back into play. That's where this Debate Day goal comes in. Be one of the 500 supporters we need to fight beside this campaign before midnight.  make you proud tonight. Thanks for standing with me.

With your support, I\u2019m confident we can continue to build on this strong foundation for a prosperous economy.Sincerely,Governor Phil Scott Scott for Vermont, Glen Wright, Treasurer,P.O.

Bush, \u2018one of America\u2019s greatest points of light\u2019------------------------------------------------------------On the day he turned 18, just 6 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, George H. W. Bush volunteered for combat duty in World War II. He would become the youngest aviator in U.S. naval history at the time, flying 58 combat missions\u2014including one that saw his plane take enemy fire and require that he parachute into the Pacific Ocean to survive.That legacy alone would be enough to earn our Nation\u2019s eternal debt and gratitude. For George H. W. Bush, it was only the beginning of a lifetime of public service. He would go on to become a member of Congress, Ambassador to the United Nations, Director of Central Intelligence, Vice President, and, finally, President of the United States.\u201cPresident Bush always found a way to set the bar higher,\u201d President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump said in a statement over the weekend. \u201cIt is with great sadness that we mark the passing of one of America\u2019s greatest points of light.\u201dPresident Trump has proclaimed this Wednesday, December 5, as a National Day of Mourning as President Bush\u2019s State Funeral is held in Washington.The President and First Lady\u2019s statement on the death of George H. W. Bush  .\u2018A great American life\u2019: President Trump\u2019s official Proclamation  President Trump returns from the G20 Summit------------------------------------------------------------Yesterday, President Trump and the First Lady returned from Buenos Aires, Argentina, host of the 2018 G20 Summit. As world leaders gathered, President Trump kept his promise to put Americans first every step of the way.The summit kicked off with a historic moment: the signing of the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement USMCA, which replaces the outdated NAFTA. For years, NAFTA helped incentivize offshoring, leading far too many manufacturing jobs to leave the United States. USMCA will rebalance American trade for the 21st century  .Another crucial meeting took place between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China. Incredible progress was made on two fronts in particular. \u201cPresident Xi, in a wonderful humanitarian gesture, has agreed to designate Fentanyl as a Controlled Substance, meaning that people selling Fentanyl to the United States will be subject to China\u2019s maximum penalty under the law,\u201d Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.And on trade, the two leaders struck an understanding that leaves \u201cunlimited possibilities for both the United States and China,\u201d President Trump said. In exchange for the Trump Administration agreeing not to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of product to 25 percent at this time, China will agree to purchase a substantial amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other product from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between America and China.Out of respect for the Bush family, President Trump has postponed a full press conference on these historic actions until after President Bush\u2019s State Funeral.Watch: Highlights of President Trump at the G20 Summit in Argentina  Photo of the Day------------------------------------------------------------Official White House Photo by Keegan BarberA portrait of 41^st President George H.

So, when it comes to politics and fighting for biblical principles, we can easily become frustrated when we don\u2019t see instantaneous results.This is one of the reasons millions of people \u2013 more specifically millions of Christians \u2013 opt out of the political process, despite the desperate need for biblical truth in our culture and in the government.I believe our instant gratification culture has many Christians believing if we don\u2019t see immediate results in the battle for religious liberty, sanctity of life, marriage, and family, then there is no hope and our involvement doesn\u2019t matter. That is a LIE. There are lots of other lies stealing America\u2019s soul.\u00a0 The lie that God is dead. The lie that truth is relative. And the lie that Christians should surrender their values and their voices.But the truth is, our faith has something essential to offer our world. It\u2019s actually what our world needs \u2013 they just don\u2019t know it. And it\u2019s why we must stand in unity and for truth.That is why My Faith Votes exists. To equip and mobilize Christians to stand for truth in our communities and in our nation, bringing the influence of our faith into the public square.It\u2019s a long-term strategy, butlook at what people like you made possible this year!  - Launched a nationwide TV and radio campaign on TBN, Daystar, Fox News, Salem, K-LOVE, the Bott Radio Network, American Family Radio, and the Christian Satellite Network\u2014reaching more than 150 million households with Biblical worldview and voting resources  - Introduced the Voting Assistance Center, the most comprehensive voting toolkit available to churches and Christian voters, along with My Voter Guide, the only ballot guide for Christians covering 100% of the 70,000 elections that occurred across the nation.  - Reached 325,000 students on 115 Christian College and University campuses equipping them to vote and vote from a biblical worldview  - Sent 4.9 million emails with faith-based news updates and 36 million Get-Out-the-Vote reminders to Christians across the nation  - Enabled concerned Christians to send 171,000 messages to elected officials expressing views on critical issues such as the Kavanaugh confirmation and immigration reform.Because of people like you, many more Christians are involved, informed, and voting in elections and transforming our communities.The truth is, our work doesn\u2019t stop or slow down just because the midterm elections are over\u2026it is not time to rest and disengage for the next two years.\u00a0The work we do in 2019 will drive the outcomes in 2020.There is much to do in 2019 to mobilize millions of Christians in 2020, but we must end 2018 strong. We need your help. Our goal is to raise $380,000 before January 1st.Can we count on you to stand with us and make a year-end contribution to My Faith Votes < gift will be MATCHED dollar for dollar, thanks to a generous matching grant, but it must be in before the end of the year!If we want to see Christians reject the lies that are destroying our country, then we need your help TODAY. Christians can speak truth to the lies in our culture IF we reach, equip and mobilize them. A donation of any amount will make a difference.Thank you for giving of your resources now so that future generations can live in a nation that honors God! < We Stand.Megan WestHost of My Faith Votes LIVE-=-=-This email was sent to .

Can you pitch in a donation today to help us get there?Kamala\u2019s rejecting corporate PAC donations into her campaign. That means every donation -- no matter what amount -- has an impact on our budget. Whether or not we reach this first end-of-month fundraising goal will impact strategic decisions like:Where -- and how much -- can we afford to hire staff in key states with early primaries?How many organizers can we hire and volunteers can we empower with new tools?Can we afford to design, print, and distribute campaign literature and merchandise?How much budget do we have to invest in digital and TV ads to introduce Kamala to millions of voters?If we\u2019re going to run our campaign the right way, it\u2019s going to take significant resources. But we wouldn\u2019t set our goals so high if we didn\u2019t think we could reach them.Our campaign is being built FOR the people, BY the people -- which means refusing corporate PAC money and relying on a real grassroots movement to sustain our campaign.Will you step up today with an investment of $10 or more to Kamala\u2019s campaign for president?

        "email_content": "\u00a0          I have really big news. Last week, the House of Representatives passed the   first major piece of legislation on gun violence in a generation. It\u2019s   called HR 8. Now, it heads to the Senate.   This bill would mandate background checks for every gun purchase in this   country. It goes a long way toward making sure people with criminal   records or a history of mental illness can\u2019t get their hands on a gun.   Right now, I need your help in making sure this bill gets a vote on the   Senate floor. We know the NRA and the gun lobby will do everything in   their power to stop it. That\u2019s why we need to come together to show the   strength of our movement.   [  ]Add your name next to mine to demand a vote this week in the Senate on   legislation to require background checks on all firearm sales in the   country.                              [  ]Sign the petition   We can\u2019t lose sight of how important this moment is in our history, and   how hard we have worked to get here.   A little more than one year ago, the students from Marjory Stoneman   Douglas High School led millions of people in marches across the country   to demand action on gun violence.   And throughout 2018, people in communities across our nation registered   voters, knocked on doors, and organized to elect leaders who are willing   to stand up to the gun lobby and do what\u2019s right.   Last week, new members of Congress like Rep. Lucy McBath -- who became an   activist for social justice after her son was shot and killed -- voted to   pass the first significant legislation on gun violence in 20 years.   This is a great step forward. When we work together, arm in arm, to   organize and raise our voices to demand action, we can win. But our fight   is not yet done. I need you to add your voice right now:   [  ]Sign now if you agree: Congress should act swiftly to pass universal   background checks \u00bb                              [  ]Sign the petition   This is just the first of many fights to come in our work to end gun   violence. I know that by working together, organizing on every block in   every community of this country, we can take on the gun lobby and win.   Thanks for standing with me on this.

Wade and protect women, just as I have since my very first day in office. This bill -- and 20 others like it enacted across the country in 2019 alone -- shows that we all must speak out. This fight requires your voice too, everyone.Please join me and recommit to doing everything in your power to uphold Roe v. Wade and protect a woman's right to be a free and equal citizen in America: Roe v. Wade is no longer just a threat. It's here. Efforts are underway now, and real people are about to suffer the consequences.We have to fight harder than we've ever fought before to stop these bans, win back state legislatures, and ensure that we have a Supreme Court that will uphold women's fundamental rights. We can't let up, not even for a second.We'll fight this head on, and we'll do it together.

By a nearly 20-point margin, the American people do not want impeachment, according to polling by the Washington Post and ABC News. Let's move on and focus on issues that actually help the country, like opioid crisis alleviation, national security, infrastructure and health care.\u201dClick here to read more.  Mueller\u2019s analysis of the obstruction evidence in his own report makes clear that no investigation was obstructed. Not the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence probe, and not his own. No witnesses were interfered with, and Mr. Mueller was allowed over two years to issue nearly 500 search-and-seizure warrants and interview anyone he wanted, including anyone in the White House,\u201d The Wall Street Journal  editorial board writes. The report also \u201cshows beyond doubt, there is no evidence of a conspiracy, broad or narrow.\u201dRobert Mueller\u2019s \u201cmessage was another disappointment for Democrats, since it boils down to: I\u2019m not going to help you drag this out,\u201d the New York Post  editorial board writes. \u201cNothing changed after Mueller\u2019s press conference. Except this: Democrats can\u2019t have it both ways \u2014 shying from impeachment but wallowing in endless investigations and testimony that create more noise without shedding any new light.\u201d\u201cLuckily for American agriculture, President Trump negotiated a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, commonly referred to as the USMCA, which will help agriculture immensely,\u201d state agriculture officials Chris Chinn, Steve Wellman, and Mike Naig write in The Missouri Times  . \u201cAcross the country and all industry sectors, the USMCA will create roughly 176,000 jobs and inject more than $68 billion into the economy by increasing exports to Canada and Mexico.\u201d\u201cEveryone is curious about how such false information could have been pushed up the Obama administration\u2019s chain of command to start a secret examination of a rival political campaign.

Knowing that it might not be the most   popular answer in my home state of Texas, I said yes. It was clear to me   then, as it is now, that the future of our democracy is at stake.   Robert Mueller just made it crystal clear. Of the hundreds of pages in his   special counsel report, he chose to highlight both the obstruction of   justice and calculated attacks on our democracy by Russia. He said   something important: when the subject of an investigation obstructs that   inquiry, or lies to investigators, it strikes at the very core of our   government's ability to get to the truth and hold people accountable.   His message was clear. If we want to prevent this from happening again, we   must hold those responsible to account. The only way we can do that is for   Congress to meet this moment and begin impeachment proceedings.   [  ]Add your name if you agree it\u2019s time to begin impeachment proceedings   so we can get to the truth and hold perpetrators accountable.   This systematic attack by Russia on our democracy demands the attention of   every American, and the only way every American can be represented   properly is through the House of Representatives. If ever there were a   moment to act, it is now. If Congress fails to do that, we have set the   precedent that some people are above the law in this country.   I believe those members of Congress who listen to the courage of their   convictions at this moment of truth will be rewarded by the judgment of   history. While we still can, we must hold the president accountable for   his blatant obstruction of justice and lies to investigators.   This is not about me running for president. It\u2019s not something I take   lightly. It\u2019s more important than any one election or one presidency. The   sanctity of our democracy is at stake, and we don\u2019t have much time.   [  ]I hope you\u2019ll join me in adding your name today to call on Congress to   begin impeachment proceedings.   Sincerely,   Beto                                 [  ]Contribute              \u00a0            Contribute to Beto's campaign:  email was sent to .

The NRA is lashing out because they know we can beat them, like we already have in Colorado--passing universal background checks and high-capacity magazine limits. My message for them: We're not going anywhere, and we won't stand down.- I released my plan to protect women's reproductive rights across our nation by making Colorado's successful long-acting reversible contraception LARC program national. This would protect the rights of all women to control their own healthcare and bodies by providing access to affordable contraceptive options such as IUDs. In Colorado, the results spoke for themselves: We saw a 64% drop in teenage abortion, a 54% drop in teen pregnancy, and the program saved taxpayers $70 million.- I went on the record calling for impeachment inquiry: Robert Mueller's press conference on Wednesday convinced me that it's time for Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to further the investigation.Week by week, we're growing this campaign and getting our message out, everywhere from local meet and greets to national outlets like CNN and MSNBC. Our vision of an America united behind smart, humane, progressive policies is gaining traction.But one more game changer hit our campaign this week. The DNC doubled the number of individual grassroots donors it will take to qualify for the later debates: from 65,000 to 130,000.Hitting that goal and taking our message to the debate stage to speak up for gun safety, reproductive rights, and more will take everyone on this team stepping up. The finance team tells me we're still over $20,000 from the goal we needed to hit by tonight, so I'm here to personally ask you:Before tonight's deadline, will you consider making your first gift to our campaign? Just $1 is all it takes to help grow this team: so grateful you're on this team and going on this journey with me.Thank you,John  -------This email was sent to .To unsubscribe, go to: "

This wasn't the first time Cenk interviewed me - you can see the first one here: This 2020 Presidential Candidate Makes A TON Of Sense < that, I recorded an episode of Pod Save America. \u00a0It was exciting to sit down with Tommy Vietor, a veteran of the Obama administration, to discuss my candidacy with their progressive audience. \u00a0I hear all the cool kids listen to that podcast.There are also a few others that we\u2019ll let you know about when we can :-The growth in our campaign isn\u2019t just reflected in the media; it\u2019s also reflected in our support. \u00a0Our social media presence is growing at a rate faster than almost any other candidate in the field. \u00a0The requirements for the second DNC debates have been released, and we\u2019re well on pace to hitting them. \u00a0We need 130,000 individual donors - we\u2019re right at 120,000.\u00a0 We also need 400 donors from 20 different states, and we blew past that. \u00a0It\u2019s a testament to the wide appeal of the Freedom Dividend that we\u2019re receiving such strong support from so many different parts of the country.BUT - we are behind on our goal to double our fundraising from Q1 and raise $3.5 million in Q2. \u00a0Doubling our fundraising will show that we have the growth and momentum necessary to win the nomination and go on to beat Trump in 2020. \u00a0Based on internal projections, we\u2019re on pace to raise just under $3 million this quarter.If you can, please help us hit our Q2 goal today by donating $23.97, our average donation so far this quarter! \u00a0If you\u2019re a first-time donor, this will help us with our fundraising goal and with qualifying for the second debates. < am deep in debate prep for June, which will be a new high-water mark for the campaign - let\u2019s take advantage of the opportunity that history has given us. \u00a0It has opened a door - let\u2019s run through it.-Andrew-=-=-Yang2020 - United States This email was sent to .

His story of not only developing but also implementing plans to improve our nation. His story of being the leader we need in this moment to defeat Donald Trump. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant raised by a single mother on San Antonio's west side, Secretary Castro has struggled and succeeded, becoming living proof of the American Dream. As a former mayor and member of President Obama's cabinet, he has not only crafted sweeping policies like those he's introduced on the campaign trail, but also seen them to fruition.These qualities are what we know can defeat Donald Trump in 2020. With 20 million people expected to tune in to NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo tonight at 9:00 PM ET, it's an opportunity to introduce a whole lot of people to the candidate who has led the field on some of the most important issues of this era.

We actually passed universal background checks, got to near universal health care, and attacked climate change with the toughest methane regulations in the country.We worked together--Democrats and Republicans, businesses and non-profits alike--to make a real difference in people's lives. We dramatically expanded reproductive rights and reduced teenage abortions by two-thirds. We were the first to legalize marijuana, and in the process transformed our justice system. And we created the number one economy in America.And we did it without radically expanding our government or touting socialism as the solution.Anyone can talk. But what matters is action.

I ask myself, \"Can this be America? Is this the way we in this country treat any human being, let alone the youngest, most fragile and most innocent among us?\" But it's true. What we're seeing now is undeniably un-American, inhumane and shameful.\u00a0For no offense of their own, sick and hungry children are left to sleep on concrete, in their own filth, without adequate nutrition and medical care. Infants and toddlers, separated from their families, are being cared for by other youngsters who may be only a few years older. Is this happening because of cruel intent, scandalous neglect or a lack of funding?Ultimately, I care less about the answer to those questions and whom we can blame, and more about how we can help these children.\u00a0Blame and dissension will not bring us solutions. That will take leadership. Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to set aside their differences and drop the endless back-and-forth finger-pointing, as well as the fighting within their own camps. Most of all, the President of United States has to be the leader here. There is no more urgent moral issue before him, but he's been engaged in the partisan blame game. That's unacceptable.\u00a0Ending this war on children has become an afterthought in Washington's endless struggle over immigration policy. But this crisis at our border is more urgent. These are children. This is America. And we have to put the children first! Without delay, marshal this nation's resources to provide safe, humane conditions for children being held, while moving just as quickly to get as many as possible out of detention and into the care of family members or other sponsors.\u00a0This means pushing our current fixation on election debates, town halls and other political concerns to one side -- and doing it right now -- so we can take care of these children first. Immigration policies, long-term fixes and the inevitable politics can come later.\u00a0Do we need secure borders? Of course. Do we need a total overhaul of our system of legal immigration? Absolutely. Republicans and Democrats should work together to pass immigration reform that meets our economic and security needs while also creating jobs for Americans. But put the needs of these children first.\u00a0In recent days there have been hopeful signs. The House and Senate have moved forward quickly on supplemental funding to ease conditions at the border. But Congress and the President need to come to a compromise that ensures the safety and well-being of these children. They must also realize that funding alone is not enough.\u00a0A real solution will require much greater accountability, a real plan for going forward and a bipartisan commitment to taking care of these kids. All of this will take time, but the needs of these children will not wait. Today -- here and now \u2014 this business of crowding children into jail-like detention centers, while denying them adequate nutrition, sanitation and medical care has to stop. No debate, no excuses, no finger-pointing. Just stop!\u00a0This disgraceful disregard for our own values is not who we are as Americans. It's not who we have ever been. To ourselves, and to so many others throughout the world, our country has represented the promise of something better. At some point we must step back, come together and do what is right for these kids. Because, only then, will our actions be right for America.Ending this war on children has become an afterthought in Washington's endless struggle over immigration policy.Share This: <  < Paid for by Kasich for America, not authorized by anycandidate or candidate's committee.www.JohnKasich.com Unsubscribe <"

        "email_content": "Friend -Today, our federal lawsuit to overhaul the election system in Georgia takes a critical step forward. This morning marks the beginning of our four month discovery track, the legal procedure by which each side in this case can obtain important evidence. And for the first time, we have an anticipated trial date set for March 23, 2020, meaning that we'll be able to pursue justice for Georgia voters on the aggressive timeline we'd requested from the court. At its core, our lawsuit argues that voters deserve fair, secure elections. Because fair elections are the moral foundation of the compact between the government and its citizens. In 2018, Georgia's elections officials broke that compact by engaging in unconstitutional voter suppression and gross mismanagement. The result was an election that deprived Georgia citizens, and particularly citizens of color, of their fundamental right to vote. Our fight is about fulfilling the most fundamental promise of democracy: the right for voters to have their voices heard and their votes counted. But we need your help. Can you make a contribution right now to support our fight for free and fair elections? CONTRIBUTE \u00bb  work is critical here, friend. What happens in our case could set a national precedent for other states to follow. We know that we must leverage every resource before the 2020 elections to ensure that every eligible voter can access the ballot and to dismantle a system of suppression that violates the Constitution of the United States of America.

That message resonated with voters across our district -- and the nation -- who were sick and tired of politicians who deepened partisan wounds by isolating themselves in the extreme corners of their parties.Their inaction hurt everyday Americans, and together, we said \u201cno more.\u201d Instead, our new generation of leaders is building bridges -- not burning them.I\u2019m reaching across the aisle and finding allies who are eager to make progress on the challenges of day-to-day life. In fact,\u00a0bipartisan legislation\u00a0I authored to increase transparency in prescription drug pricing passed out of two committees and is working its way towards becoming law.There are countless other issues I\u2019m confident we can find common ground on, but to do that, we need to keep this district in the hands of voters and out of the pockets of dark money donors funding extreme ideologues.Peter -- Your grassroots support today can help us make the most of these early fundraising deadlines and put us in a strong position to cross the finish line again with a victory in hand.

Dear Friend, When Governor Cuomo attempted to cut funding for veterans' mental health programs this session, Nicole stood up with her colleagues, fought back and got the funding not only restored, but increased. Then, when the Governor and the democrat controlled State Legislature passed a budget that gave free college tuition to illegal immigrants, Nicole successfully made the case on Tucker Carlson that these types of benefits should be going to the children of disabled or deceased military men and women. A week later they were. Appearing on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Nicole slams New York Legislature's decision to give free college tuition to Illegal Immigrants before Gold Star Families. WATCH NOW And in June, when the democrats attempted to sneak a bill through that would have automatically allowed illegal immigrants to vote, Nicole exposed it and got the bill killed. This is the type of proven leadership Nicole has displayed and she is the type of fighter we need in Washington. Please chip in $10, $25, $50, or any amount you can to help Nicole fight for us.

We\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s worth mentioning again; Millennials and Generation Z will be the largest voting bloc in 2020.

Pastor Pokluda helps explain how we can do just that.\u201cMillennials underestimate what they can do with long obedience in the same direction. I think they overestimate what they can do in the short term. And so what they are not doing well is patience, but what they are doing well is belief \u2014 believing that they can change the world.And if they take that belief and place it in something bigger than themselves \u2014 they begin to understand the purpose of why they were created.

It\u2019s Stacey Abrams\u2019s top priority. Her political machine has already held dozens of events around the state and they won't be stopping anytime soon. They are working overtime to turn Georgia into California.On top of all of this, Abrams continues to receive constant attention from the national liberal media.

        "email_content": "Today's a federal holiday because on the eve of the 20th century, workers from across the country fought side by side and made their government recognize the importance of labor. Machinists, carpenters, and people who worked in mills, mines, factories, and more joined together to fight for better wages, better conditions, and a day to honor the power of working people. The fight for labor continues today. Out on the trail, I've spoken with union members who are teachers, nurses, postal workers, home health aides, janitors, truck drivers, and more. Labor groups are still fighting for an America that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. They were on the front lines then, and they are on the front lines now. This is a crucial moment in the fight for workers in our country. Right now, the rich and powerful are doing everything they can to break the backs of unions. But unions aren't going away -- not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Unions built America's middle class, and unions will rebuild America's middle class. And I've got plans to rewrite the rules of our economy to give workers more power. Together, let's make it easier to unionize. Let's give those unions more power, get the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board to actually look out for labor, pass a nationwide ban on so-called \"right to work\" laws, and more. This is a crucial moment in the fight for workers in this country. It's a time for us to show whose side we're on. I'm proud to say that my campaign is unionized. All Democrats need to stand up and say, without hedging, that we support unions and we support legislation that will protect workers. Throughout history, workers have gotten together and gotten organized. Kids went from working in factories to going to school. Americans went from working twelve hours a day, six days a week, to the 40-hour week we know now.We must remember that when working people fight, working people win. And today, fighting shoulder to shoulder for big, structural change is how we're going to create an economy that works for everyone.Thanks for being a part of this,ElizabethDONATE NOW:  for by Warren for President____________________________________________All content \u00a9 2019 Warren for President, All Rights ReservedPO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02116____________________________________________This email was sent to .Click here to donate by mail:  unsubscribe, go to:   "

These 28 individuals all came from different walks of life, but each one hoped to be a part of the American Dream that\u2019s seen as a symbol of hope throughout the world. This week, nearly 34,000 other individuals like these 28 will be welcomed with open arms as the newest citizens of the United States of America.\u201cYou all have one thing in common: You aspired to be Americans,\u201d Vice President Pence said. \u201cYou stepped forward, you followed the law, you went through the process, and, today, you are American citizens.

This Constitution Week, America welcomes 34,000 new legal citizens  President Trump arrives in California!------------------------------------------------------------President Donald J. Trump continues his tour out West today, arriving in sunny California after spending last night in New Mexico.Despite liberal state leaders who often fail to address the state\u2019s most pressing challenges, Californians have seen incredible results under President Trump\u2019s economic program. Job creation has rebounded in a big way, with more than 870,000 jobs added since President Trump\u2019s election. Perhaps even more impressive, in that same time period California\u2019s unemployment rate fell from 5.4 percent to 4.1 percent\u2014a record low.The difference-maker wasn\u2019t more high-tax, big-government policies that the people of California have grown accustomed to seeing from their leaders. It was the pro-growth, workers-first agenda that President Trump began implementing on day one.But despite these gains, California cities continue to be hampered by a severe homelessness problem that the state\u2019s left-wing leaders consistently fail to address.Nearly a quarter of the entire U.S. homeless population resides in California\u2014about 130,000 people. Today, four of the five major American cities with the highest rates of unsheltered homelessness are in the state. To illustrate how dire the problem is, San Francisco has a rate of unsheltered homelessness of 60 per 10,000\u201410 times greater than the national average.How did this happen? There is plenty of blame to go around in the state\u2019s leadership, but in general, left-wing policies such as overregulation have deepened the crisis, driving up the prices of homes and leaving more people unable to afford a roof over their heads.Making matters worse, many liberal leaders continue to ignore the rule of law\u2014and the will of the people\u2014by enabling massive illegal immigration. In the end, it\u2019s their own constituents who pay the price. San Francisco\u2019s leaders have loudly pushed for open-border policies even while their communities face a worsening homelessness crisis.President Trump is calling them out. His Administration is paving the way for more affordable housing development and bringing needed reforms to America\u2019s housing finance system. Real work is already being done to reduce the risk factors for homelessness, such as improving addiction treatment and mental healthcare, as well as promoting career opportunities for former prisoners. Hopefully California leaders take note.Something to share: President Trump has delivered big results for California!  New York Times: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Cities Are Unlivable.

        "email_content": "[ BY ADMIRAL JOE SESTAKAutism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD, affects millions of families across the United States. As a member of Congress, I fought hard to secure the first new federal funding for autism treatment and services in over twelve years. The vehicle was the annual defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2009 and the focus was increasing funds for families who have a loved one with ASD. At the time, I said this: \u201cA new case of an autism disorder is diagnosed every 20 minutes, affecting one in every 150 American children as the fastest-growing serious developmental disease in the United States.\u201d Sadly, in the decade since then the autism rate has risen to one in every 59 American children. Of course, it\u2019s still quite unclear whether these numbers point to a steep increase in cases of ASD or merely in better public education about the condition and increased diagnoses, but in either case it is a serious concern demanding far more attention from policymakers.Some doctors and researchers are concerned that because of the complex nature of Autism Spectrum Disorders \u2014 and the wide range of treatments that have been tested \u2014 there may never be a complete \u201ccure.\u201d But there have been many advancements, and research is still revealing new information about autism every day. Some believe that gene therapy may yet provide a cure. But most everyone believes that early diagnosis and intervention can improve quality of life for people with autism and their families. Due to the brain\u2019s plasticity, especially when children are very young, early intervention with the latest behavioral therapy techniques is showing great promise. We must increase funding, as part of the transition to a universal healthcare system, for evidence-based, medically necessary therapies and services for people with autism. And we must also increase funding for expanded research into the efficacy of various therapies, because there still has not been nearly enough such research thus far.Critically, we must also devote more resources to discovering the cause or causes of autism. While a \u201ccure\u201d still proves evasive, we must do everything we can to reduce the number of cases of ASD. We need to find out why the rate of autism is increasing faster among African American and Hispanic people, after having long been more prevalent among the white population, and how environmental factors and genetic factors come into play. Scientists are exploring many theories \u2014 from prenatal infection to hereditary genetics, chemical exposure to gastro-intestinal microbes, and combinations of multiple factors \u2014 but they lack the necessary resources to swiftly come to any conclusions. The federal government must step up and find the funding required to get the job done. We have no way of knowing how such research may improve the lives of people living with autism already, but we know it is our best chance at reducing the number of cases in the future.I fought throughout my time in Congress to increase support for individuals and families living with autism, beginning with military families. As President, I will continue to do everything in my power to support all Americans with autism and their families.If you'd like to know more about my positions on autism, on healthcare more generally, or on other issues, please visit my website at www.joesestak.com [ .

Back   then, not a lot of folks knew where to stand on the issue and weren\u2019t sure   if it was the best path to go down if we want to unite our country.   But everything we\u2019ve learned these past weeks since we found out about   Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine has confirmed an undeniable truth: Trump   will do anything to interfere with our elections again if it buys him a   victory.   For years, our president has believed he\u2019s above the law and it\u2019s time to   prove him wrong.

[  ]Sign the petition   The question of impeachment has only become more urgent every day that   passes in this lawless administration.\u00a0   Just the other month, Mueller testified to Congress and confirmed that   Trump is not innocent when it comes to Russian interference in the 2016   election.\u00a0   This week, Trump was on live television when he asked China and Ukraine to   open an investigation into one of his political opponents.   And on Thursday night, House investigators released numerous text messages   that clearly show how senior State Department officials were involved in   leveraging a deal between the Ukrainian president\u2019s top aide and President   Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, that would promise a summit between their   country\u2019s leaders in exchange for information about Biden\u2019s son.\u00a0   Since day one of his administration, Trump has made it clear that there is   nothing too immoral, too despicable, or too corrupt that he won\u2019t do to   advance his own political agenda and personal interests. His shamelessness   has hit rock bottom. We need to let him know that nothing about committing   crimes in public makes them any less criminal.   I believe our country is rising up right now to issue that call \u2013 more   Americans than ever recognize that this will be a defining moment in our   nation\u2019s history. I\u2019m inspired to see more Democrats who were previously   on the fence about going forward with impeachment, stepping up to say   enough is enough \u2013 no one is above the law. And I\u2019m proud to hear that a   record number of Americans now support going forward with impeachment.   [  ]Let\u2019s send Trump a message that Americans aren\u2019t standing on the   sidelines when it comes to his impeachment and saving our democracy.

Will you chip in to get us closer? campaign manager, Addisu, told the world last week that we have to raise almost $3 million -- $2,998,771 to be exact -- in October to cover our campaign expenses and continue to grow a movement that can win.Over the past eight months, I've had the opportunity to meet hardworking Americans across the nation and hear directly from them about what a better America for all should look like. I've heard from grieving parents in New Hampshire about the loss of their daughter to the opioid epidemic. This is an issue that's sweeping America and I've pledged my support to tackle the very serious problem our country is facing.I've heard from a concerned young woman in Iowa about what I'd do to bring the country together to stop the gun violence plaguing our nation. She moved to Decorah a year ago from Las Vegas after the shooting. She courageously fought through tears explaining how the shooting changed her life forever -- all while being accompanied by her eight-year-old sister.It's conversations like these that have inspired the things that I will fight for beginning on day one of entering the White House.

That led me to become a doctor in the Army, where I treated wounded soldiers during Desert Storm. After I was discharged, I practiced pediatric neurology for more than 25 years in Norfolk.Treating sick children, and children living with disabilities, really opens your eyes to the importance of health coverage -- meaningful, affordable, quality coverage. Access to good health coverage means a patient can see a doctor before a pain or a cough turns into a major illness. Good, meaningful coverage means you can afford your medication, and that your health insurance policy actually covers the health care you need. We provided that, working in a bipartisan way, when we expanded Medicaid in 2018, providing more than 320,000 Virginians with affordable, real health coverage.But meaningful coverage is under threat from Donald Trump and legislators here in Richmond.That's why we need to secure a Democratic majority in the General Assembly on November 5.Please fight with me by chipping in $10, $25, $50 or an amount of your choice so we can flip the legislature and improve access to quality health care in Virginia.As a doctor and as governor of Virginia, I want the best health care for all Virginians. I will leave no stone unturned as I look for ways to make that happen.Thank you for your help. Let's win on November 5!Take care,RalphThis email was sent to .To unsubscribe from The Way Ahead email list, please click here.Paid for by The Way AheadThe Way AheadPO Box 597Richmond VA 23218"

Chris Smith has stood by silently, rubber stamping this agenda.Now, I'm running to represent the 4th District in New Jersey because I believe we need to work to repair our democracy and fight for what's right.As a former government employee, attorney, and human rights activist, I know I can be a great leader for the 4th District, can you commit to this campaign and donate what you can below?  a kid, my parents taught me that I should be active in my community, do good, and give back. They taught me the difference between right and wrong.Those lessons from such an early age led me to spend my career working to advance democracy and the rights of women and girls at home and abroad.Chris Smith has been on the wrong side of progress--of history--for this country and this district for far too long.And as we've witnessed breaches of democracy--the Muslim Ban, widespread corruption, and attempts to restrict the right to vote by this Administration--Chris Smith has stood by. I'm running against him so that our democracy will be stronger and your rights will be protected. But I can't do this alone. I fundamentally believe we need more people to courageously stand up to Smith -- and win. That's why I need you on my team. Standing beside me.

That, along with a last minute half-million dollar check from Mike Bloomberg put her over the edge in this conservative district.But is she really a moderate?Take the election for Speaker of the House for instance. Horn spent the entire election refusing to commit her vote for Nancy Pelosi, like so many so-called moderate Democrats across the country.But what was the first thing she did when she got to Washington? She teamed up with AOC and the Squad to make far-left California liberal Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the House.That's not moderate, and Pelosi's values certainly aren't Oklahoma values.We think we can convince Oklahomans to say NO to Kendra Horn's extremism in 2020, but we need resources in order to make sure they hear the truth about her.That's why we need your help.Will you donate $5, $10, $15, $25, $50, or even $100 to help us get the word out about Kendra Horn's far-left values? She's just another Pelosi rubber-stamp and we can't afford to have her in Congress another two years.  KENDRA HORN  has called Oklahoma's 5th district \"a seat both parties expect to work fiercely to win in 2020\" and the Washington Post has rated this the number two race in the country. National Journal has gone one step further and says this is the nation's number one battleground district, and Decision Desk HQ has said \"OK-5 is guaranteed to be one of 2020's most bitterly fought House elections.\"Oklahoma's 5th district is going to be ground zero for the fight to take back the House in 2020. That's why we need your help.  contribute $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 to help us show Oklahomans Kendra Horn's true colors as just another radical liberal Democrat.

        "email_content": "   Team --I got into politics to fight for the issues that matter to everyday families, like access to quality, affordable health care, raising the minimum wage, and leveling the playing field.But it's clear Republicans in Congress have a very different set of values. Two years ago today, Republicans like my opponent, Jason Lewis, rammed through a partisan tax bill which passed in the dead of night in the Senate! that put the wealthy and corporations above everyday Americans.Families thought they would see a boost in their paychecks or higher refunds during tax season -- instead, 83% of the benefits will go to the top 1% by 2027 while many middle-class families watch their taxes go up.Small businesses thought they would have room to get off the ground -- instead, big Fortune 500 corporations paid no federal income taxes and got billions in tax cuts to enrich their wealthy investors and CEOs, leaving workers in the dust.People everywhere hoped the GOP tax bill would make their lives easier -- instead, they played hardworking Americans for fools.I'm determined to win re-election next year and keep Minnesota away from the GOP's grasp. But if I'm honest, we have a very tough fight ahead of us. Right-wing special interests will do whatever it takes to keep their influence in Washington and those tax breaks in their pockets, so I'm asking for your help today:If you're sick and tired of the GOP turning their backs on the American people to please their wealthy donors, then donate $10 or more to help us save Minnesota's Senate seat by hitting our critical FEC goal. Every dollar will go toward keeping our state from flipping red next year.CONTRIBUTE:  had enough of Republicans laughing and congratulating themselves on profiting off the backs of everyday Americans. With your help, we can win re-election here in Minnesota, take back the Senate for Democrats, and put power back in the hands of the people.Thanks for reading. -- TinaThis email was sent to .

They're packing the federal courts with radical right-wing judges determined to overturn Roe v. Wade.Today, on this 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, here's what you need to know about Joe:1. He has a 100% voting record on reproductive rights, as rated by Planned Parenthood and NARAL.2. He has championed legislation in Congress to repeal the Hyde Amendment to ensure that low-income people have access to abortion care, including through any future Medicare for All legislation.3. He has been a strong and early federal advocate for the ROE Act, a state law that would break down barriers to abortion access in Massachusetts.4. He has been a strong advocate for maternal health care for every pregnant person, including those most at risk and most in need; including improving access to postpartum care through Medicaid. Joe believes every woman -- and pregnant person -- deserves full bodily autonomy. It's time to codify Roe v. Wade into law. Just as he has in the House, Joe will take the fight for reproductive justice directly to the conservative right in the U.S. Senate.No more attacks on Roe v. Wade. No more attacks on reproductive freedom. - Team KennedyAre you with us? Chip in ${ask} now!  email was sent to .Too much email?

        "email_content": "[ Andrew ]Andrew Yang for President   Yang Gang --   Thank you for your incredible support these past months.\u00a0 You all have   uplifted me and inspired me and Evelyn and this campaign at every turn.\u00a0   Your passion and energy.\u00a0 Your donations and hundreds of thousands of   hours of calling and volunteering.\u00a0 Your enthusiasm, dedication and   commitment.   We have accomplished so much together.\u00a0 We have brought a message of   Humanity First and a vision of an economy and society that works for us   and our families to millions of our fellow Americans.   We went from a mailing list that started with just my Gmail contact list   to receiving donations from over 430,000 people and support from millions   more across the country.   One of the things I\u2019m most proud of -- we gave $1,000 a month for a year   to 13 families across the country.   We highlighted the real problems in our communities as our economy is   being transformed before our eyes by technology and automation.\u00a0 We stood   on the debate stage and shifted our national conversation to include the   fourth industrial revolution, a topic no one wanted to touch.   Our signature proposal, Universal Basic Income, has become part of the   mainstream conversation.\u00a0 We increased the popular support for Universal   Basic Income to 66% of Democrats and 72% among voters 18-34.   And without a doubt, we accelerated the eradication of poverty in our   society by years, perhaps even generations,   And that is thanks to all of YOU!   Though thousands of voters came out for our campaign tonight in New   Hampshire, it is not the outcome we fought so hard for.\u00a0 It is bitterly   disappointing for many of us.   But it should not be.   Every single day I\u2019ve had supporters say to me:   \u201cYour campaign helped me out of a depression.\u00a0 Thank you.\u201d   \u201cWorking on this campaign has made me a better human being.\u201d   \u201cI met my significant other because of you.\u201d   \u201cYour campaign brought my family together.\u00a0 Your campaign got me excited   about politics for the first time.\u201d   These are all things that people have said to me in the past days.\u00a0 I\u2019m   incredibly proud of this campaign.\u00a0 We have touched and improved millions   of lives and moved this country we love so much in the right direction.   And while there is great work left to be done, I am the MATH guy.\u00a0 And it   is clear tonight from the numbers that we are not going to win this race.\u00a0   I am not someone who wants to accept donations and support in a race that   we will not win.   And so tonight, I am suspending my campaign for president.   This is not an easy decision.\u00a0 Endings are hard and I\u2019ve always intended   to stay in this race until the very end.\u00a0 But I have been convinced that   the message of this campaign will not be strengthened by my staying in   this race any longer.   Endings are hard.\u00a0 But this is not an ending.   This is a beginning.   This is the starting line.\u00a0 This campaign has awakened something   fundamental in this country and ourselves.   We\u2019ve outlasted over a dozen senators, governors, and members of Congress   and become the most exciting force in this entire race.   The Yang Gang has fundamentally shifted the direction of this country and   transformed our politics, and we are only continuing to grow.   My goal when I first started was always to solve the problems that got   Donald Trump elected.\u00a0 And I know in order to do that, I will support   whoever is the Democratic nominee.\u00a0 That said, I hope this campaign can be   a message, and word of caution, to all of my Democratic colleagues.   Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems.\u00a0 He is a symptom.\u00a0   We must cure the disease that got him elected, and in order to do that we   must address the real problems that affect our people and offer solutions   to actually solve them.   Those solutions are bold, and many think they are crazy.\u00a0 But I hope my   campaign has made it a little less crazy to think we can lead our country   to eradicate poverty.\u00a0 In fact, five candidates in this field have already   supported it or expressed openness to supporting Universal Basic Income.   I stand before you today and say that while we did not win this election,   we are just getting started.   This is the beginning.   This movement is the future of American politics.   This movement is the future of the Democratic party.   This wave is just beginning and it will continue to build until we rewrite   the rules of this economy to work for us, the people of this country.   Thank you to each and every person who made this campaign possible, I love   and appreciate you.\u00a0 Being your candidate has been the privilege of my   life.\u00a0 We will continue to do the work and move this country forward.   Thank you all.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 And God bless the United States of   America.   -AndrewPaid for by Friends of Andrew Yang<p style=\"font-size:small\"> <br> <a href=\" can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time.</a> </p>"

We all agree that our health care system isn\u2019t working for the vast majority of people, that corporations have a dangerous amount of sway in Washington, that we need to act now to save our dying planet, and that we must defeat Donald Trump in November. That\u2019s common ground for all of us.\u00a0But I disagree with many of the solutions that the other candidates are putting forward to solve these problems. The solution isn\u2019t to put the government in charge of large parts of our economy. The solution isn\u2019t to force people to give up a union-negotiated health care plan that works for them, as Senator Sanders and Senator Warren propose. Unchecked capitalism has failed, but we still need a competitive, dynamic private sector \u2014 one that\u2019s regulated with fair and just parameters \u2014 to actualize a government that\u2019s truly of, by, and for the people.And here\u2019s one other thing I want to tell you: I am absolutely committed to fighting for the values I talked about on stage tonight.\u00a0My heart is in these issues, and if yours is too, volunteer to reach out to\u00a0potential voters in South Carolina before their primary on Saturday.  is not the time to take a step back.

James Madison didn\u2019t include the Second Amendment in the Constitution so that Americans could go deer hunting!It was placed in the Constitution because England became tyrannical and Americans had to have the ability to wage war using single fire muskets, mind you to secure our freedoms.In addition to that, modern Americans, generally do not own weapons of war, nor do they own \u201cassault rifles.\u201d Civilian rifles that are purchased today are not weapons of war. I spent 27 years in the United States Army. I think I know what weapons of war are.Automatic weapons have not been used in recent mass shootings. In the shootings in Orlando, New Town, Ct., and San Bernardino, semi-automatic weapons, one requiring you to pull the trigger each time to fire a cartridge, were the weapons used.Most so-called experts on the left have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. The next time someone talks about banning assault rifles, please explain to them that most assault rifles are already banned and not legal to be owned by 99% of the population.The constant attempts to revoke our God-given rights to protect ourselves and our freedoms have gone on long enough.

It has been my honor to earn your support, hear your stories, and travel across Dallas and Collin Counties meeting the hard working people of the 32nd district. The wide swaths of support our campaign received last night from across the district is humbling, and I am proud to be the Republican nominee for Congress in District 32. It is more important than ever that we unite and confront what we're all up against \u2013 Colin Allred and a Democratic party that grows more radical each day. He campaigned as a moderate in 2018, his record has been anything but. He votes with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 94% of the time. He continually joins his liberal bosses in voting to harm the North Texas economy and he has made his support for radical policies very clear. Colin Allred does not share our Texas values of limited government and fierce independence. Over the next eight months, I look forward to sharing my positive vision for the 32nd district we all know and love. A vision deeply rooted in my career in business, where I\u2019ve created hundreds of jobs and seen first-hand what it means to be fiscally responsible and balance a budget.

Well, not anymore. Things can change quickly in politics... and in life.South Carolina proved to be the big win Joe Biden needed, and three days later, that momentum pushed him to victories in most of the Super Tuesday states. A week later, he won most of the states again. Looking at the states yet to vote, pundits agree it would take a minor miracle for anyone but Joe Biden to be the eventual nominee.It seems that Democrats have turned away from Bernie Sanders and the socialist option he was championing. However, a close examination of Joe Biden reveals he has adopted many of the policies of his party\u2019s left-wing.Joe Biden appears to have the nomination well in hand, but the coronavirus has paralyzed the campaigns and the nation.

Now, I know that with all that's happening right now, our FEC deadline is probably not at the top of your list of things to pay attention to. That's why I want to give you an explanation of why it's so important we raise $10,000 before March 31st.New York's 24th Congressional District is one of our best chances to expand our House majority -- it's one of only three districts still held by a Republican despite Hillary Clinton winning here in 2016. The only way we'll be able to work toward a progressive agenda in Congress is to win districts like this.So please, will you make a donation towards our $10,000 end-of-quarter fundraising goal? Any amount would be a huge help.Chip In \u2192  Republican opponent, Congressman John Katko, has failed central New York for far too long. It's never been more clear that we deserve representation that will listen to real people -- not special interests and the rich and powerful.I will be the Congressman our district deserves. I promise I will not let you down.If you can, dig deep, and make a donation to our campaign today. Reaching our $10,000 end-of-quarter goal will show Katko and the GOP that we are prepared to flip this seat."

This is just the latest example showing how out of touch Democrats are with the rest of the nation.

We only need to flip one seat in the House and three seats in the Senate to break their supermajority and protect Governor Kelly's veto powers.

My team and I are working to adjust our strategy amid this new reality and continue our work to save Minnesota\u2019s Senate seat. With that in mind, I wanted to share some news:Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight recently released an analysis giving Democrats new hope that we have what it takes to flip the Senate.While Republicans kicked off the election cycle with the upper hand, Democrats in key Senate races across the country are surging in the polls and outraising their GOP opponents.We currently hold the advantage when it comes to pick-up opportunities in states like Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, Maine \u2014 and holding strong here in Minnesota, Michigan, New Hampshire, and more.That\u2019s all thanks to grassroots supporters like you who have helped put Democrats like me on the path to victory. But with a few months left to go until Election Day, there is still a lot that can change \u2014 in our race and others.Senate control could go either way, which means we must capitalize on our momentum. Can you pitch in $10 or more to help us save Minnesota\u2019s Senate seat and take back the majority? Thanks in advance.Contribute now:  Republicans are seeing the same reports we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s why their super PACs and mega-donors are dumping millions into key Senate races to defeat Democrats. We can\u2019t let them get away with it.With your help, I know we won\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen what this incredible team is capable of in moments like these and I\u2019m confident that if all of us come together, we can flip the Senate.Thank you for anything you\u2019re able to chip in, but if you can\u2019t afford to give today \u2014 that\u2019s okay! Taking care of yourself and your loved ones are the most important things you can do right now. I\u2019m just thankful to have you on our team.\u2014 TinaP.S.

But we also can't ignore the facts:If the rest of the map stays the same, Donald Trump can lose Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but if he wins Minnesota, he wins re-election. That\u2019s basically the whole ballgame.Look, Trump only lost Minnesota by one and a half points. That makes our state one of his top targets this year, and he won\u2019t let us slip through his fingers again. Super PACs supporting him dumped millions into Minnesota in 2018, and the Trump campaign has already pledged to spend millions more this time around.This is a must-win seat if Democrats are going to take back the Senate majority, and it\u2019s a must-win state if we\u2019re going to get Trump out of the White House. But we've got an expensive fight on our hands. So, I\u2019m asking:If it makes sense for you financially, can you chip in just $10 to help us hold strong in Minnesota?

As Warren Democrats, we need to fight by her side.Together, we can fill our government with more leaders who will fight for our progressive values. We can keep the voices of working people front and center as we recover from this crisis and rebuild our country. And we can make bold, inclusive reform to address the root causes of how we got into this mess.We only have three more days left to hit our April fundraising goal and fully fund our outreach for May. We understand that with everything else happening, not everyone is going to be able to make a financial contribution to this movement right now.But if you're in a place where you're able to donate, a contribution of $2 or anything you can would go a long way -- to keep growing our movement, to elect Democrats like Elizabeth, and to fight for big, structural change. is the most important election of our lifetimes, and we need all hands on deck.This year, we need to send Donald Trump packing, keep the House, take back the Senate, and elect state legislators and governors who'll keep Republicans from gerrymandering themselves into power after next year's redistricting.The fight won't be over in November -- we'll need to keep working to end corruption and make our government work for everyone -- but we also can't wait until November.So we'll keep advocating day in and day out for the pandemic relief measures we desperately need today, and we'll make sure we elect Democrats up and down the ballot to see this crisis through for working families. Side by side, we'll root out corruption in government and put power in the hands of the people.We're building a powerful organizing network to get this done -- but it takes real resources. It's going to take a grassroots movement funded by grassroots donors like you.If you can, please make a contribution before Thursday's monthly fundraising deadline -- so we can hit our goal for April and hit the ground running in May. for everything, and stay safe,Warren DemocratsDONATE NOW:  for by Warren Democrats____________________________________________All content \u00a9 2020 Warren Democrats, All Rights ReservedPO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02117____________________________________________This email was sent to .To unsubscribe, go to: "

        "datetime": "02/05/2020 17:25",
        "email_content": "Your daily Rhode Island COVID-19 update  Hello friend, This crisis is hitting those who can least afford it the hardest. There are many folks out there who are finding themselves in difficult financial positions and are worried about paying their bills and affording a place to live. No one should have to worry about this right now. Today, I want to tell you about our new emergency rental assistance program to help Rhode Islanders get through this crisis. To stay up to date with Rhode Island's latest COVID-19 statistics, please check the Department of Health's new data dashboard for all the information you need about the spread of coronavirus in Rhode Island. I\u2019m proud to announce that we have $1.5 million in emergency rental assistance available to low-income renters who have been impacted by the COVID-19 emergency and are at immediate risk of homelessness. Those who qualify can receive a grant of up to $5,000 to support past due rent payments and other fees. It's important to emphasize that this is for people who are already behind on their rent due as a result of COVID-19. It's my hope that this fund will allow us to alleviate the burden of the low-income workers who have been hit hardest by this crisis. Starting today, you can go to HousingHelpRI.com to view the requirements and apply. If you don\u2019t have consistent access to the internet and have questions about the application process, you can call the United Way at 211 for more help. This crisis is also affecting homeowners in Rhode Island, and so I also want to remind everyone that more than 20 financial institutions in RI have signed a pledge that provides relief to residential borrowers. All of the participating institutions are listed on the DBR website. As a reminder, they\u2019re offering: A 90-day grace period for all residential mortgage payments for individuals impacted by COVID-19, with the opportunity to request additional relief An agreement to not report late payments to credit reporting agencies for residential borrowers who take advantage of this relief  A 60-day moratorium on initiating residential foreclosures and evictions; and An agreement to waive mortgage-related late fees.  This is a perfect example of people stepping up to do the right thing and help others in a time of need. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to get us through this crisis. We\u2019ve all had to sacrifice through this crisis in big ways and small ways, and I know that it's becoming more and more challenging every day to continue social distancing. We all miss seeing our friends and our extended families. However, we need to keep going. If we do, we\u2019re going to be in a better place to move along with our reopening, and throughout the summer we\u2019ll be able to safely get together with the people we love and miss. But we\u2019re not there yet. Please, do the right thing and continue to follow the stay at home order.  -Gina Raimondo Governor P.S.: Information is our greatest weapon in the fight against COVID-19, If you or someone you know wants to sign up to receive these emails, you can use this link.

Trump.But I\u2019m afraid my opponent doesn\u2019t have your best interest in mind, and she certainly does NOT support our president.It pains me to report Liberal Lying Lisa will do anything to get ahead, even lie to you regarding her support of the president.While you may have heard her say she will \u201cwork with President Trump.\u201d The facts are that she refused to even utter his name at her own kickoff rally!\u201dHow can we trust her to support our President when she doesn\u2019t even have the courage to embrace him on the campaign trail?And to make matters worse, Liberal, Lying Lisa, joined the Never Trump movement with a maximum donation to John Kasich when he was running against President Trump., without your financial support, I am afraid we could have another anti-Trump RINO in congress.Your contribution of only $5 or $10 will go a long way in spreading my pro-Trump, pro-freedom message! Can I count on you to make that contribution today?DONATE NOW!  for me, supporting our president is a no brainer.However, other so-called \u201cRepublicans\u201d in this race don\u2019t seem to have the same idea.I need your help to continue to expose Liberal, Lying Lisa for who she really is, an anti-Trump swamp creature.DONATE NOW!  tuned for our next message later this week.For Freedom,Dean BrowningConservative Republican for Congress, PA-07P.S. \u2013 Did you know Liberal, Lying Lisa is ANTI-TRUMP?!?!Yes, it\u2019s true, and I need your help to fight back against the herd of RINOs.Can I count on you to donate $5 or $10 today?DONATE NOW!

        "email_content": "Peter,Since mid-March, over 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment.I want you to pause for a moment and think about that: more than 30 million people are currently out of work, and yet they\u2019re expected to pay their bills in full and on time as if we\u2019re not all living through a dire financial crisis. Americans are being told to stay home for the sake of slowing the spread of COVID-19, and the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that we can all remain safe and financially secure while doing so.If you agree that Congress must provide quick relief to Americans grappling with a pandemic that\u2019s costing millions of jobs and has made it tougher to pay the bills, will you add your name today?  HERE  leaders can cancel rent payments. They can pause all payments of debts that consumers are unable to cover during the crisis and ensure that no American incurs interest, late fees, or other penalties for nonpayment. They can protect stimulus payments from debt collectors, and once this crisis ends, they can call on creditors to give people enough time to catch up on missed payments. It\u2019s possible -- we just need to demand that our leaders fight for us.It\u2019s going to be a long road to recovery, but Congress has the power to ease this burden on working and middle-class families everywhere: Join me today in demanding they do their job by enacting protections for consumers in the next COVID relief package.

Instead, she\u2019s done what all desperate candidates do, centered her campaign on baseless attacks and the most negative ads she can run. In fact, Beth was forced to pull her illegal ad from the air just two days after the Republican chairs in the 27th district demanded that Parlato \u201csuspend her negative campaign and promote your own candidacy rather than viciously attacking others.\" Buffalo News, 5/13/20 < The only people Beth seems to attack are her fellow Republicans. First my colleague and friend Rob Ortt, and now me. The only person Beth hasn\u2019t attacked is my radical, liberal opponent\u2013 Nate McMurray. One county chair described Parlato\u2019s negative campaign as \u201cthe continuation of a destructive behavior pattern for her own self-promotion,\u201d and said it seems \u201clike she's working with Nate McMurray.\" Buffalo News, 5/13/20 < I\u2019m committed to keeping this seat in Republican hands and I am proud to have the endorsement of President Trump.

First, I want to thank everyone who has made a donation -- this week, this month, this quarter. Thank you for showing your continued support for Mark and for this entire team. After the Republican primary in June, we'll know who will face Mark in the November general election, and our work will kick into high gear. Our team is already buckling down to keep Mark in the Senate, where he's working hard for every Virginian. In moments of uncertainty, we need people like Mark, who are willing to roll up their sleeves and work until the job is done. He is fighting to make sure bi-partisan relief packages benefit Main Street over Wall Street, calling on internet service providers to expand access and remove restrictive broadband caps for rural Virginians, and laying the groundwork to make sure that everyone has the ability to safely cast their vote come November. We haven't been able to have an in-person event in almost three months, and our team is working tirelessly to give folks the opportunity to engage online with virtual town halls and digital organizing opportunities. Our fundraising has understandably slowed down, and we're working hard to make up the difference so we can press forward and spread Mark's message to folks across the Commonwealth. We need your help. I know that many folks in Virginia and around the country are facing hardship right now, but I'm asking that you consider supporting real leadership in Washington if you have the means.Any amount you can give today will help get us closer to meeting our June fundraising goal -- every dollar makes an impact.

Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, in several crucial states.He lashed out at Mr. Parscale and said it was other people\u2019s fault that there had been fluctuations in a race they had all seen as his to lose just two months ago. At one point, Mr. Trump said he would not lose to Mr. Biden, insisted the data was wrong and blamed the campaign manager for the fact that he is down in the polls, according to one of the people familiar with the conversation.

And it's worse for Black women and Hispanic women, who on average are paid 62 cents and 54 cents, respectively, for their work compared to a man's $1.The Equal Pay Act was passed 57 years ago -- and it's time for us to do something to actually honor the mission of the act.In Congress, Christy would advocate for enforcement measures and accountability regarding the wage gap to make sure every worker is paid the same wage for the same work, regardless of their gender identity, race, religion, sexual orientation, age, or any other difference. Equal pay for equal work should not be a question or a debate any longer -- it is a right we need and deserve. If you agree, add your name to Christy's petition calling for the enforcement of the Equal Pay Act now >>ADD YOUR NAME >>  the wage gap still exists in 2020 is unacceptable -- and we must work hard now to make sure future generations of workers do not receive different wages for the equivalent work. That this is even a discussion we have to have is ridiculous.

        "email_content": "Hi friend,During the primary elections, Georgians faced up to 8-hour lines and thousands of absentee ballots that were never received. Depending on where a person lives in Georgia, their access to this fundamental right differs, and that is unacceptable. The Secretary of State is not taking responsibility and choosing to blame under-resourced county officials and under-trained poll workers, but the Georgia Constitution makes clear that the buck stops with the Secretary of State. He is the chief election official, and it is his job to make sure that every Georgian has the right to vote without undue burden. That's the job he asked for. That's the job he's got. Therefore, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger must fix the problem immediately - before millions of Georgians face hours in line, risk COVID-19 exposure, unsent absentee ballots, and uncertainty about whether their votes will count.Raffensperger said he wanted difficult voting experiences to be one in a billion and that no Georgian should have to wait more than 30 minutes to vote. If that's what he wants, he must take steps to make this a reality. He has failed to provide counties with the resources and training to meet the standard he set. Right now, the Secretary of State has proposed legislation, Senate Bill 463, that does the exact opposite.  \u25cfEvery County Is On Its Own: SB 463 changes the law to say that the State Election Board - responsible for oversight - no longer has to actually do its job. The bill will instead make it each county's problem, without the necessary training, funding, or support.  Rather than taking steps to reduce lines, the bill will tell every Georgian that they only get the democracy their county can afford.  For rural counties, our largest area, this means we will see a WORSENING of the current problems in Georgia, where democracy looks different depending on which county you live in.  The state should be supporting counties, not hanging them out to dry, so voters have equal access to the vote.  \u25cfGuess Where You Vote: SB 463 fails to properly notify voters of polling locations changes, which will lead to longer lines and more provisional ballots if voters go to the wrong location. Due to COVID-19, locations may not be available. Voters should not be penalized, and if the law does not mandate notification, too many Georgia voters will be forced to risk missing the election altogether.\u25cfDefacto ID Requirement: SB 463 enacts a new ID provision, that could turn into a de facto ID requirement whereby voters must have access to printers to mail copies of their ID to ensure their ballots are not rejected. This new provision may cause more absentee ballots to be rejected because of the new rules, which will lead to longer lines as voters who requested ballots have to vote in person. This provision goes in the WRONG direction.\u25cfNot Enough Equipment: SB 463 fails to mandate the appropriate number of machines at each polling location and fails to ensure enough check-in stations, all of which lead to longer lines as people have to wait in crowded lines, increasing their risk of illness or losing their right to vote. \u25cfToo Risky To Vote In Person: SB 463 fails to expand access to vote by mail, which will lead to longer lines. Georgia saw an unprecedented number of voters use vote-by-mail. This keeps those who can vote from home safe AND it protects brave poll workers, the disabled, those with language barriers, the displaced, and those who could not send in their ballots. The more folks who vote from home, the safer it is for those who have no choice but to vote in person. We NEED YOUR HELP TO FIX THIS VERY BAD BILL AND NOT LET THE SECRETARY OF STATE PASS THE BUCK TO COUNTIES & CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS. EVERY VOTER IN GEORGIA MUST BE PROTECTEDTHIS IS HOW YOU CAN HELP: Call David Ralston NOW and tell him to FIX SB 463: 404-656-5020 #gapolCall House Government Affairs Chairman, Shaw Blackmon and tell him to FIX SB 463: 404.463.7853 #gapol-------This email was sent to .To unsubscribe, go to:  for by Fair Fight Action"

Pat\u2019s campaign is showing real momentum after the primary. I\u2019m ready to lead the effort to build on the energy you have created in order for this campaign to defeat Jackie Walorski in November.The 2nd District needs a formidable leader who consistently shows up, is prepared, understands your concerns, and works to improve the quality of life for you and all Hoosiers.That\u2019s why I believe Pat needs to be the next member of Congress for Indiana-02. Her nearly forty years of service in this district as attorney, teacher, and small business owner uniquely prepare her for this role. I look forward to serving you, the voters of this district, as Pat\u2019s campaign manager to make sure every voter in this district hears Pat\u2019s message of Dignity and Justice for All.STAND WITH ME \u2192  MePrior to joining Pat\u2019s campaign, I worked on Amy Klobuchar\u2019s presidential campaign in both New Hampshire and Arkansas leading teams of staffers and volunteers to build the on-the-ground campaign structure, organize events with Amy, and conduct voter outreach. In 2018, I was a Regional Field Director for the Virginia Democratic Party, where I oversaw field efforts in 27 counties.I also attended the George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management where I received a Master\u2019s in Political Management and Electoral Politics.The main lesson I\u2019ve learned throughout my experience in politics is that it\u2019s critical to understand why people care about their community and why they participate in democracy.June 30th is the all important end of quarter deadline where numbers raised will be noted by national organizations watching this race since winning the primary. Please consider making an investment right now to send the message that this is a people-powered campaign. Anything you\u2019re able to give helps tremendously.

I hope you have a relaxing and safe holiday, spending quality time with loved ones. This year Stacy and I will spend the holiday at home, watching fireworks on TV, along with thousands of other Hoosiers.This Fourth of July comes at a difficult time for our country. Hoosiers -- and Americans -- have not yet recovered from the public health crisis, or the economic crisis, that is the coronavirus pandemic. We are also experiencing a new civil rights era, triggered by a national reckoning with systemic anti-Black racism in the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Dreasjon Reed, and others by police.Our country isn\u2019t perfect; it takes work to make it the place it could be. Show your patriotism by taking actions to improve this country, like donating to charity, engaging in community service, peacefully protesting against injustice, or voting for candidates and policies that will help people.This Independence Day, we remember and celebrate the promise of what America should strive to be.Thank you for all that you do,Dr. Woody MyersDONATE [                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [ for by Myers for Governor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             PO Box 1903                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Indianapolis, IN 46206                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This message was sent to your email address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Woody Myers is running to be Governor of Indiana because he knows our state needs new leadership where people are first - not politics.

Grassroots supporters like you power this campaign, Peter, and we need you with us to make sure we keep growing this campaign like never before. So, we're asking:Can you make your first contribution to Joe Biden's campaign today? Anything you're able to give will make a real difference. this is a critical phase for our campaign. Joe is preparing to choose a running mate, we're approaching the Democratic National Convention, and we're now in the last full fundraising quarter of the general election.And Donald Trump's failed leadership shows us every day just how important it is that we defeat him in November.We know it might be a hard time to give right now, Peter, but if you can, will you chip in your first $5 today? We can't beat Trump and elect Joe Biden without you. for all you do for this campaign,Team Joe----PAID FOR BY BIDEN FOR PRESIDENTThis email was sent to .To unsubscribe, go to: "

Click here to hear Corky\u2019s take on recentsocial unrest, healthcare and more.Corky also visited last week withJack Heath, on NH Today, to chat about President Trump\u2019s endorsement,the COVID-19 pandemic and much more. Tune in! Why Won\u2019tSenator Shaheen Take a Stand on Broad-Based Taxes?Last week, Corkycalled on U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen to publicly take a stand on thequestion of an income or sales tax in New Hampshire. The decades-olddebate about broad-based taxes is heating up with Governor ChrisSununu\u2019s recent veto of House Bill 712 passed by theDemocrat-controlled New Hampshire House and Senate -- a bill that theGovernor considers an income tax. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans are onceagain talking about \u2018the Pledge\u2019 and whether an income or sales tax isan economic necessity or political ploy,\u201d said Corky. \u201cAs our mostsenior elected Democrat official, Senator Shaheen is in effect the headof the state\u2019s Democrat Party, and as such, she owes it to her partyand all Granite Staters to make clear whether or not she favors a stateincome tax.\u201cBut as is her pattern, Senator Shaheen hangs to therear on critical issues, and when the dust settles, she claims she wasfor the winning side all along, whichever side that might be. That\u2019swhat she calls being a \u2018moderate.\u2019 That\u2019s what I call being politicallyexpedient.\u201dEvery New Hampshire governor, Democrat or Republican,has taken \u201cThe Pledge\u201d opposing a sales and income tax, with oneexception: in seeking her third term as governor, Jeanne Shaheenrefused to do so. While she did win re-election, her support of astatewide sales tax was defeated.\u201cWith our economy here in NewHampshire still reeling from the effects of pandemic closures andrestrictions, you might expect our elected officials to come down onthe side of taxpayers, and reject any and all attempts to burden uswith income and sales taxes, whether you call them that or not,\u201d saidCorky. \u201cThe last thing our residents and business owners need right nowis another economic hit.\u201dCorky Continues to Meet with Granite StatersThe campaign is picking up momentum and support, as Corky takes hismessage to voters across New Hampshire. He has met with GOP groups inWindham/Derry, appeared at the Salem Chamber of Commerce's EconomicDevelopment Breakfast, and continues to talk with Granite Staters abouttheir concerns at every opportunity, in person or via Zoom or FacebookLive events. In the weeks leading up to the September primary, you canbe sure Corky will continue to reach out and share his message ofindividual liberty and economic freedom.Shaheen\u2019s First TV Ad BringsStrong ResponseCorky last week shared his response to U.S. SenatorJeanne Shaheen\u2019s first campaign ad, a television spot focused on NewHampshire opioid crisis.\"My dad battled with an addiction to opioids,so I know firsthand the pain and challenges it brings to people andtheir families,\" said Corky. \"No one will be a bigger champion for thiscause than me in Washington.\"\"However, it\u2019s no surprise that D.C.Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s first ad of the cycle tries to put distance betweenherself and her party. The fact is, though, no matter how hard shetries, she can\u2019t run from the swamp she has immersed herself in. TheSenator is the head of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. A partythat nationally has been overrun by the likes of Bernie Sanders, AOC,and Ilhan Omar. A party that today wants to make our streets less safe,that wants to tear down our political system and replace our economywith socialism.\"Corky concluded: \"She cares more about pleasing\u2018The Squad\u2019 than she does about getting New Hampshire families back towork. No slick ad contrived by her political machine will be able tomask who she is and who pulls her strings.\"The Corky Store is NowOpen!The for Senate store is NOW OPEN - have you checked it out yet?

        "email_content": "Your RI COVID-19 News Update  Hello friend, This was our first week holding only one press conference a week. If you weren't able to catch it on Wednesday afternoon, don't worry.There's a lot going on these days, and it's easy to miss things. That's why I wanted to put together a quick recap for you of the new announcements from the past week.   I'll still be sending out these emails every day so that you can get the most recent info when you need it. If you know someone who wants to stay up-to-date on the latest measures Rhode Island is taking to stop the spread of COVID-19, send them this link: lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/eYMG9tf. The better we stay informed, the better we'll be able to keep ourselves, our families, and our friends safe from COVID-19. BEACHES Effective this past Thursday, parking lots at Misquamicut and Scarborough State Beaches will be reduced to 25% capacity to reduce the volume of visitors. I\u2019m sorry that we have to do this, but it\u2019s necessary. Crowding at our beaches last weekend was the worst we\u2019ve seen it since this crisis began, and that spilled over into crowding at local restaurants and bars. If we want to stay open, we need to stay safe.   We\u2019ll be working with municipalities to crack down on illegal parking around our beaches and we\u2019ll increase enforcement at local businesses. We\u2019ll also have staff on the beaches to hand out masks to folks who don\u2019t have them. If we start to see these same issues at other beaches, we\u2019ll put restrictions on them too. If we continue to see issues, we\u2019ll close our state beach parking lots entirely. RESTORE RI   We\u2019re supporting Rhode Island small businesses with a new program called Restore RI, through which we will directly invest $100 million. $50 million of this money will be made available in grants of up to $15,000 as part of the first round of funding to provide direct cash assistance. These funds will help businesses facing reopening expenses such as plexiglass, cleaning supplies, and touchless pay technology, as well as fixed costs like rent and utilities. Yesterday I had a video conference with our congressional delegation to talk about how CARES Act funding will power this important program.   That money will both help business stay open and keep employees and customers safe. It is essential that this money reaches businesses in every part of the state as quickly as possible. Our team at Commerce is working around the clock to be able to make applications available in the next two weeks and to get you all the info you need to take part in Restore RI. If your businesses needs this support, you can prepare to apply by reviewing the details on CommerceRI.com or by calling 521-HELP.   REBUILDING RHODE ISLAND This week, I shared my vision for rebuilding Rhode Island's economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to embrace what we\u2019ve learned, and not just go back to the old way of doing business. The fundamental makeup of our economy has changed. We can't shy away from the hard truth that a lot of the jobs we've lost aren\u2019t coming back.     But there's another truth that we can't turn a blind eye to either: the old way of doing business left a lot of people behind. Let\u2019s address these inequities head-on, together. Let\u2019s build a better, more equitable, more innovative economy. That requires making major investments in education, job training, small businesses, and housing. I\u2019m excited to announce that I\u2019ll be dedicating more than $200 million in federal stimulus funding to support these programs.  I hope you find this recap helpful. It's so important that everyone stay engaged and informed so that we can all stay safe and healthy. I'll be back on TV with more updates this week Wednesday at 1 p.m. We're all in this together. -Gina Raimondo Governor P.S.: Information is our greatest weapon in the fight against COVID-19, If you or someone you know wants to sign up to receive these emails, you can use this link.

        "email_content": "Less than 100 days from Election Day, our country is in crisis.The fight for social, racial, and economic justice has reached a new threshold. Coronavirus is raging out of control. Unemployment is at Great Depression levels. And Trump is unable to govern at even the most elementary level.But if we work together -- if we fight together -- if we persist together -- we can elect new leaders who will make decisions with compassion, common sense, and moral clarity.The next 100 days will decide what kind of country we build together. And earning people's votes takes time -- we need to be reaching out, person to person, right now, to make sure everyone makes their voice heard this November. Especially this year when more voters than ever will cast their ballots before November.So the next four days before our July fundraising deadline will decide what kind of investments we can make in grassroots organizing to win big across the country in the coming months.If we don't hit our goal by Friday, we won't have all the resources we need to keep growing our movement. If you're able to, please pitch in $2 or whatever makes sense right now -- it would make a real difference. the past month, alongside grassroots supporters like you, we've endorsed dozens more Democrats running across the country.These Warren Democrats will make us proud by fighting for the bold reforms we need at every level of government. But to elect them in 2020, we need to keep making serious investments in person-to-person organizing.This is our moment to build back our economy and our government better than ever before. So when our children and our grandchildren ask what we did to end one of the worst chapters in our nation's modern history, we can tell them we changed America.Grassroots supporters like you are the only people who can make it possible to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond.If you can, will you help hit this goal by Friday's fundraising deadline? for being a part of this,ElizabethDONATE NOW:  for by Warren Democrats____________________________________________All content \u00a9 2020 Warren Democrats, All Rights ReservedPO Box 171375, Boston, MA 02117____________________________________________This email was sent to .To unsubscribe, go to: "

Even though women make up more than 51% of the population, we have never had more than100 Democratic women serve at the same time in the U.S. House of Representatives.North Carolina got a \"D\" rating for women's representation in the state's government and politics. That's not OK.I founded Off the Sidelines, because I believe that when women have a seat at the decision-making table, we can make our country a better, more equitable place for everyone. I'm fighting to elect strong, progressive women up and down the ballot, and I couldn't be more excited to endorse and support Kathy as she runs to become the very first woman to represent North Carolina's 6th District in the House.Join me in supporting Kathy's campaign today \u2192 Kathy has lived in North Carolina's 6th for 30 years, and for 30 years, Kathy has made meaningful contributions to make her community a better place to live for all North Carolinians.As an immigration attorney and community leader, Kathy worked to ensure North Carolinians could afford to put food on the table and pay their bills. She fought to ensure everyone has an equal opportunity for strong education and jobs.And Kathy saw firsthand how devastating the astronomical cost of health care can be on a family when her daughter was diagnosed with a chronic illness and her insurance company told her it would cost her thousands of dollars out of pocket a month to keep her daughter healthy.There's no doubt in my mind -- we need someone with Kathy's personal and leadership experience in Congress. So if you are able, contribute today to make Kathy the very first woman to represent NC-06 in the House.Thank you,Senator Kirsten Gillibrand FOR BY KATHY MANNING FOR CONGRESS If you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please unsubscribe:  "

The response -- everyone coming together across our communities -- gave us all hope that real change was possible.It's a stark reminder, as we enter hurricane season in Texas, of why we need to set aggressive goals to fight climate change right now -- because if we wait, it's just going to keep getting worse. In 2008, I flew search and rescue missions in Galveston after Hurricane Ike, and I saw the devastation first-hand -- and just as Harvey was worse than Ike, the next big storm is going to be even more devastating than the last.Our biggest challenges require decisive leadership from those in positions of power. As we look at the crises facing our country, we just don't see that from Sen. Cornyn: Joking as a devastating pandemic kills thousands and leaves millions more unemployed in our state, taking zero action to face head-on the increasing threat of climate change, deflecting on pressing matters of policing and criminal justice reform and refusing to say plainly that Black lives matter.It's why I'm running for Senate -- but I need your help to win. Pitch in to help me bring bold leadership and real solutions to our biggest challenges to the Senate.>>>  can't afford six more years of Sen. Cornyn, and I'm counting on you to help me defeat him.-- MJDONATE:  clear we need a real leader for Texas and a Senate that prioritizes our health care.

The litigation in that case is heating up, meaning Mondaire isn\u2019t able to spend as much time fundraising as he needs to in order to win the General Election. That\u2019s why donations from emails like this are more important than ever. If we\u2019re going to keep up the great work, including fighting for a free and fair election this fall, the rest of us have to do more to help Mondaire meet every single monthly fundraising goal. This month\u2019s fundraising goal is 1,500 donations, and right now we\u2019re 427 gifts short. *Can you make a contribution today to help us get there? If every person reading this email makes a donation, no matter how much you can give, we\u2019ll meet this goal in no time. < We simply cannot afford to fall behind. A missed goal now means we will have ground to make up closer to the election, when Mondaire will already be working around the clock campaigning and advocating for voting rights.

        "email_content": "Bill Olson for Congress Peter,My name is Bill Olson, and I am a conservative Christian combat vet who just overwhelmingly won my primary, by 20 points! I am the new Republican nominee, running to take back Florida\u2019s competitive 9th District, currently held by Socialist Democrat Darren Soto. And I will stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump as we fight far-Left Socialism! President has been telling us for years and years about the disgusting injustice of the media. They exist to tear the American people down, to promote their far-Left agenda.I truly believe many of them are evil people.But none of their antics are worse than what they did to Nick Sandmann, the Covington Catholic student a high school kid.The media, especially CNN and the Washington Post, immediately attacked this kid. They incited violence; death threats to him and his family forced the family to go into hiding and the school to close temporarily.In a word, these grown adults were trying to destroy this kid- to cancel him. This is what the far-Left media does.They lie, they destroy, they incite, and they do everything they ever can to avoid telling the truth.But they had never yet met the indomitable Nick Sandmann!Like a pro, Nick and his lawyers savaged CNN, the Washington Post, and two dozen other Fake News media outlets. While the exact amounts due to Sandmann are unknown, it is telling that Wikipedia now refers to Nick as the \"owner of CNN\"!I was in tears when I saw Sandmann speak at the Republican National Convention this week.      Image Sandmann, an 18-year-old graduate from Covington Catholic High School who was at the center of a nationwide viral video controversy, lambasted \"cancel culture\" in his speech to the Republican National Convention, calling on the country to join President Trump in calling the media out.\"I wouldn\u2019t be canceled. I fought back hard to expose the media for what they did to me and won a personal victory. While much more must be done, I look forward to the day that the media returns to providing balanced, responsible and accountable news coverage,\" he said. \"I know President Trump hopes for that too.\"He continued: \"In November, I believe this country must unite around a president who calls the media out and refuses to allow them to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts. I believe we must join with a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism.\"Nick is now a freshman in college. And while he will be CNN's highest paid employee for many years, it took guts to come and speak out about our unethical attack dog media.      Image media are dedicated to the complete destruction of America, and they are equally devoted to the destruction of every single American who loves freedom and loves our country!Here's the good news: The American people see the media for what it is!A new poll released on Tuesday shows Americans have a growing distrust of the media, with an overwhelming majority saying the press have a political bias and nearly half saying news outlets display a \"great deal\" of bias.The poll noted an increase in the percentage of Americans who see too much bias in ostensibly objective reporting as a \"major problem.\" According to the poll, 73 percent of Americans share that belief, up from 65 percent in 2017.Meanwhile, a stunning 84 percent of Americans agree that \"the media is to blame for political division in this country,\" though the same percentage also believe the media \"can serve as a healing force.\"Nearly nine out of ten Americans agree with Nick Sandmann about the faults of the media. But they only win if we let them!  That's why we MUST win this year!      Image an unapologetic patriot, unlike Joe Biden. Darren Soto sure as heck is not- he votes with Pelosi 93% of the time! He's a puppet of the extreme Left.This very week, Nancy Pelosi called us Republicans \"enemies of the state\". Knowing the history that led up to World War II, this should send chills down the spines of all Americans.But I have taken an oath to the Constitution- one that has no expiration date! I don't have crazy Pelosi's money, which is why I need your help to counter the media's lies! am calling all Trump patriots to help me to replace Socialist Darren Soto, and stand up for our freedoms as Americans!

While my opponent may have corporate PAC money, I have all of you. Can I count on you to chip in to keep the momentum and help us spread our message across IL-16?  debate made it obvious that Adam Kinzinger underestimated us. But now, our campaign is fully on the Republican Party radar. That is why I need your help.Let\u2019s cross the finish line victorious in November, and give the people of IL-16 the type of representation they deserve.

Every day, his presidency further erodesdemocracy, threatens the vulnerable, and shifts wealth and power tothe 1% \u2014 to Trump and his friends.It\u2019s no small matter: We must defeat Trump, and defeat him by thebiggest possible margin, and that means voting for Biden.At the same time, we cannot depend on Biden or the Democratic Party ontheir own to deliver the scale of change that ordinary Americans sodesperately need. To end big money politics. To win a Green New Deal.To guarantee healthcare for all. We\u2019re going to have to push them.Voting on the WFP ballot line is two birds with one stone: you\u2019rehelping to defeat Trump AND building the power of the progressivemovement in New York.WE NEED A STRONG WFP TO MAKE NEW YORK INTO THE PROGRESSIVE LEADER WEKNOW IT SHOULD BE -- AND THAT\u2019S WHY I\u2019M URGING YOU TO JOIN ME INVOTING ON THE WFP BALLOT LINE THIS YEAR.[ New York, and increasingly across the country, the Working FamiliesParty is one of the most powerful voices for the progressive movement,and WFP has elected dozens of progressive leaders who fight for thepeople, not the powerful \u2014 including massive upsets like for JamaalBowman.WFP candidates beating real estate-backed incumbents in the New YorkState Senate is what allowed the passage of last year\u2019s landmarktenant protections. It should come as no surprise that powerfulcorporate interests and the politicians who serve them in both partiesdon\u2019t like that one bit.And it\u2019s why Governor Andrew Cuomo keeps trying to destroy the WFP:because WFP is critical to the change we\u2019re making in New York. ANDAS A RESULT, THE THRESHOLD TO KEEP WFP\u2019S PARTY STATUS IS MORE THANTHREE TIMES WHAT IT USED TO BE THIS YEAR, AND WE HAVE TO FIGHT LIKEHELL TO PROTECT THE BALLOT LINE.Our movement is growing. Don\u2019t let big money blunt our momentum ortake down one of our most critical organizations. [ IN VOTING ON THE WFP BALLOT LINE FOR BIDEN AND HARRIS.[ hundreds of thousands of progressives vote together on the WFPline, it\u2019s a statement to the establishment that can\u2019t be ignored.This is an easy one. If you\u2019re voting for Biden in New York and youshould be! would you rather strengthen the New York State DemocraticParty controlled by Cuomo and determined to shut out progressives orhelp defend the WFP from his attacks?Solidarity,-Zephyr _You are receiving this email as a supporter of Zephyr Teachout andNew York Progressives.

And it continues to be no easy task. Contribute[ why I\u2019m especially proud that Judicial Watch is having moreimpact fighting corruption and government secrecy now than in anyother period since opening our doors in 1994. And 2020 has alreadyproved to be even more pivotal: * We filed no fewer than 7 lawsuits against U.S. government agenciesto get to the truth about the corrupt Hunter Biden-Burisma Holdingscompany relationship and then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s use ofAmerican aid dollars to put an end to the investigation of BurismaHoldings in Ukraine\u2026and we\u2019re now putting the same level of focuson the Hunter/Joe Biden shenanigans in China! * Court-ordered releases of emails, other documents and sworntestimony to Judicial Watch continue to shed light on HillaryClinton\u2019s corrupt State Department. We literally altered the courseof history in 2016 with our first massive investigation into her emailand pay-to-play scandals, and we continue to force releases ofdocuments the American people have a right to see! * Having filed more than 65 separate lawsuits against governmentagencies and departments we continue to \u201cturn over every rock\u201duncovering the Deep State conspiracy to torpedo the Trump presidencythat reached from the highest levels of the former Obamaadministration to deep within our \u201cpermanent government\u201d andliberal mainstream media. The truth about this attempted coup must beexposed because election results have no impact on our commitment toholding corrupt public officials accountable. * Our history-making work protecting the honesty of our elections isnow helping disrupt the Left\u2019s plans. To help prevent voter fraud,we continue to successfully sue states who fail to clean their voterrolls of dead, moved and other ineligible voters. In 2019 we reachedan historic legal settlement with California and Los Angeles County toremove up to 1.59 million registered names from the county\u2019s voterrolls, and we are now suing Colorado, North Carolina and Pennsylvaniaover their failure to clean their voter rolls. * Our immigration law enforcement work continues to lead thenation\u2019s wars against illegal immigration as we fight in the courtsto overturn sanctuary policies. This is essential work, since hundredsof liberal jurisdictions ignored Trump administration efforts to shutdown sanctuary policies. Judicial Watch is scheduled to go to trial inApril of 2021 in a challenge of San Francisco\u2019s infamous and deadlysanctuary policy. We also filed a lawsuit against a similar sanctuarypolicy in Santa Clara County, California. The outcome of theselawsuits will have a potentially historic impact on the illegalimmigration debate.Overall, no one is working harder than your Judicial Watch to drainthe swamp in Washington, fight illegal immigration and illegalsanctuary policies, and hold powerful politicians accountable to theAmerican people under the law.AND THAT WHY I ASK YOU TO JOIN OUR FIGHT BY MAKING YOUR BESTTAX-DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO JUDICIAL WATCH NOW[ nation needs us even more, and I AM COUNTING ON YOU TO JOIN OURFIGHT[ workhas never been more important \u2013 or urgent!
